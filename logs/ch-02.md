## Reading Level Characteristics Applied

**Senior High (Grades 10-12) features implemented:**

- **Sentence length:** 15-22 words average
- **Vocabulary:** Technical terms introduced with definitions (displacement, velocity, acceleration, kinematics)
- **Explanation style:** Balance of concrete examples (cars, balls, runners) and abstract concepts (instantaneous velocity, calculus hints)
- **Examples:** Mix of real-world (traffic light, airplane runway) and somewhat abstract (graphs, equations)
- **Mathematical level:** Algebra-based with introduction to calculus concepts (derivatives, integrals mentioned but not required)
- **Visual frequency:** Non-text element every 3-5 paragraphs as recommended

## Pedagogical Approach

**Concept ordering (simple to complex):**
1. Started with observable quantities (distance, speed)
2. Progressed to vector concepts (displacement, velocity)
3. Introduced rate of change (acceleration)
4. Built graphical intuition (three graph types)
5. Formalized with equations (kinematic equations)
6. Applied to special cases (free fall)
7. Synthesized with problem-solving framework

**Bloom's Taxonomy alignment:**
- **Remembering:** Definitions and formulas
- **Understanding:** Concept comparisons and explanations
- **Applying:** Worked examples with step-by-step solutions
- **Analyzing:** Graph interpretation and multi-step problems
- **Evaluating:** Problem-solving framework and error checking
- **Creating:** Challenge problems requiring synthesis

## Implementation Notes

**Skills needed for completing interactive elements:**

1. `microsim-p5` skill - For implementing the 5 p5.js MicroSim specifications

3. `mermaid-generator` or illustration tools - For the diagram specification
4. Chart.js or D3.js - For the multi-panel chart specification

**Recommended next steps:**

1. Generate MicroSims using the `microsim-p5` skill with the detailed specifications provided
2. Create static diagrams and charts based on specifications
3. Review and test all interactive elements with students
4. Gather feedback on content clarity and pacing
5. Generate quiz questions using `quiz-generator` skill
6. Create glossary entries using `glossary-generator` skill
