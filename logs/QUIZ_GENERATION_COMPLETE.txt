RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ENHANCEMENT
================================================================================

HIGH PRIORITY:
1. Rebalance answer distribution (A, B, C, D to 25% each)
   • Impact: High (improves assessment validity)
   • Effort: Medium (answer reshuffling)

2. Expand concept coverage for Ch 6 and Ch 10
   • Ch 6: Add 1-2 questions on Energy Diagrams
   • Ch 10: Add 1-2 questions on Interference and Standing Waves
   • Impact: Medium (better alignment)
   • Effort: Low

3. Add higher-level cognitive questions to Ch 10-12
   • Currently: 0% Evaluate, 0% Create
   • Target: 10% Evaluate, 5% Create
   • Impact: High (better assessment of advanced concepts)
   • Effort: Medium (complex question design)

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
• Create alternative question variants (2-3 per concept)
• Generate study guides linked to quizzes
• Add difficulty labels (Easy/Medium/Hard)

LOW PRIORITY:
• Export to LMS format (Moodle/Canvas XML)
• Build comprehensive quiz bank
• Integrate with chatbot systems

================================================================================
USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

1. VIEW QUIZZES IN MKDOCS:
   $ mkdocs serve
   → Navigate to each chapter in web browser

   → Questions are interactive (click "Show Answer" to reveal)

2. ACCESS METADATA:
   Location: /docs/learning-graph/quizzes/ch*-quiz-metadata.json
   Use for: Quiz analytics, randomization, concept analysis

3. GENERATE ADDITIONAL FORMATS:
   Extend generate_physics_quizzes.py to:
   • Export to CSV/Excel
   • Generate LMS imports
   • Create alternative questions
   • Build quiz banks

4. INTEGRATE WITH OTHER SYSTEMS:
   • Student assessment platforms
   • Learning analytics dashboards
   • Chatbot training data
   • Adaptive testing systems

================================================================================
