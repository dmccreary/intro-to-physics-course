In this physics class, you\u2019ll trade textbooks for trebuchets, memorization for machine-building, and passive note-taking for active world-bending. One day you\u2019re calculating the perfect angle to sink a basketball shot; the next, you\u2019re designing a Rube Goldberg machine that takes three minutes to flick a switch, then defending your design like a TED speaker. You\u2019ll decode the physics behind your favorite video games, demolish movie scenes with real science, and turn lab day into a friendly competition to launch projectiles with laser precision. It\u2019s a place where failure is just data, \u201cEureka!\u201d moments happen weekly, and you\u2019ll walk out seeing hidden mechanics in everything\u2014from your phone\u2019s touchscreen to the way light dances on water. Challenging? Absolutely. But between the collaborative chaos of creation, the thrill of cracking a problem that stumped you yesterday, and the sheer joy of making something move exactly as you predicted, you\u2019ll realize the secret: physics isn\u2019t just the foundation of engineering and technology\u2014it\u2019s one of the most genuinely fun rides high school has to offer.</p> <p>Prerequisites: Algebra II, Geometry

These skills are essential for fields ranging from engineering and sports science to video game physics and aerospace design.</p>"},{"location":"chapters/03-motion-two-dimensions/#kinematic-equations-in-two-dimensions","title":"Kinematic Equations in Two Dimensions","text":"<p>You've already mastered the kinematic equations for motion in one dimension from Chapter 2.

By systematically analyzing friction, tension, inclined planes, pulleys, and circular motion, you've developed the skills needed to tackle complex multi-force scenarios encountered in engineering, physics, and everyday life.</p> <p>Key Concepts Mastered:</p> <p>Friction: You learned that friction opposes relative motion between surfaces and comes in two forms\u2014static friction (adjustable up to a maximum) and kinetic friction (constant magnitude). The coefficient of friction characterizes how easily materials slide against each other, with $f_s^{max} = \\mu_s N$ and $f_k = \\mu_k N$.</p> <p>Tension: Ropes and cables transmit pulling forces called tension. For massless, inextensible ropes, tension is uniform throughout and equal on both ends. Analyzing tension problems requires drawing separate free-body diagrams for each object and applying Newton's second law systematically.</p> <p>Inclined Planes: Objects on slopes experience weight components parallel ($mg \\sin \\theta$) and perpendicular ($mg \\cos \\theta$) to the surface. Choosing coordinate axes aligned with the incline simplifies calculations. The critical angle at which objects begin to slide relates directly to the friction coefficient: $\\theta_c = \\arctan(\\mu_s)$.</p> <p>Pulley Systems: Pulleys redirect forces and, when arranged properly, provide mechanical advantage. The Atwood machine demonstrates how connected masses accelerate based on their mass difference: $a = (m_2 - m_1)g / (m_1 + m_2)$.

Rocket propulsion is based on conservation of momentum.

Angular displacement (\u03b8) measures the change in rotational position. It's typically measured in radians (rad), where 2\u03c0 radians = 360\u00b0 = 1 complete rotation.

In this chapter, we explored mechanical waves\u2014disturbances that propagate through media, transferring energy without permanently moving matter. We distinguished between transverse waves (perpendicular particle motion) and longitudinal waves (parallel particle motion), and learned to characterize all waves using wavelength, frequency, period, speed, and amplitude.</p> <p>The superposition principle explains how waves interact: when waves overlap, their displacements add. This leads to constructive interference (waves combining to larger amplitudes) and destructive interference (waves canceling). Standing waves result from interference between waves traveling in opposite directions, creating stationary patterns of nodes and antinodes.</p> <p>Waves exhibit three key behaviors when encountering boundaries and obstacles: - Reflection: Bouncing back from boundaries - Refraction: Bending when entering a new medium with different wave speed - Diffraction: Spreading around obstacles or through openings</p> <p>The Doppler effect describes how frequency changes when sources or observers are in motion, explaining phenomena from ambulance sirens to astronomical red shifts. When sources exceed the wave speed, shock waves form, creating sonic booms.</p> <p>Sound waves exemplify all these principles. These longitudinal mechanical waves travel at speeds depending on the medium (343 m/s in air at 20\u00b0C). We measure sound intensity using the logarithmic decibel scale, which matches our ears' perception. Pitch relates to frequency (audible range: 20-20,000 Hz), with infrasound below and ultrasound above this range. Loudness relates to amplitude and intensity.</p> <p>Musical sounds arise from complex wave interactions: - Beats: Interference between slightly different frequencies creates pulsing loudness - Harmonics: Instruments vibrate at multiple frequencies simultaneously, creating rich timbres - Acoustic resonance: Objects vibrate strongly at their natural frequencies, amplifying specific sounds</p> <p>Understanding waves gives us insight into everything from how musical instruments create beautiful sounds to how doctors use ultrasound to see inside the body, from why earthquakes are so destructive to how bats navigate in total darkness.

Electric field lines show the direction of the electric field at any point. They emanate from positive charges and terminate on negative charges. The density of field lines indicates field strength\u2014closely spaced lines mean strong field, widely spaced lines mean weak field. Field lines never cross.</p> <p>Concept Tested: Electric Field Lines</p> <p>See: Chapter 12 - Electric Charge and Electric Fields</p>"},{"location":"chapters/12-electric-charge-fields/quiz/#6-what-is-the-relationship-between-electric-field-and-electric-potential","title":"6.

Electric potential (V) is the work per unit charge to move a test charge from a reference point. Electric field (E) is related to potential by E = -dV/dx. Potential decreases in the direction of the electric field. Electric field is more fundamental; potential is derived from it.</p> <p>Concept Tested: Electric Potential</p> <p>See: Chapter 12 - Electric Charge and Electric Fields</p>"},{"location":"chapters/12-electric-charge-fields/quiz/#7-what-is-electric-potential-difference-voltage","title":"7.

Potential difference (voltage) is the work per unit charge: V = W/q. It's measured in volts (V), where 1 V = 1 J/C. A 12 V battery does 12 joules of work for every coulomb of charge that flows through it. Voltage drives charge flow in circuits.</p> <p>Concept Tested: Voltage</p> <p>See: Chapter 12 - Electric Charge and Electric Fields</p>"},{"location":"chapters/12-electric-charge-fields/quiz/#8-a-positive-charge-is-moved-against-the-direction-of-an-electric-field-what-happens-to-its-electric-potential-energy","title":"8.

What happens to its electric potential energy?","text":"<ol> <li>It decreases</li> <li>It remains constant</li> <li>It increases</li> <li>It becomes zero</li> </ol> Show Answer <p>The correct answer is C. Moving a positive charge against the electric field (opposite to field direction) requires work against the field. This work is stored as increased electric potential energy, similar to lifting an object against gravity. The electric potential increases in this direction.</p> <p>Concept Tested: Electric Potential Energy</p> <p>See: Chapter 12 - Electric Charge and Electric Fields</p>"},{"location":"chapters/12-electric-charge-fields/quiz/#9-what-are-equipotential-surfaces","title":"9.

Equipotential surfaces are locations where the electric potential has the same value. Moving along an equipotential surface requires no work because potential doesn't change. Equipotential surfaces are always perpendicular to electric field lines, just as surfaces of equal height are perpendicular to gravitational field direction.</p> <p>Concept Tested: Equipotential Surfaces</p> <p>See: Chapter 12 - Electric Charge and Electric Fields</p>"},{"location":"chapters/12-electric-charge-fields/quiz/#10-how-is-charge-conserved-in-an-isolated-electrical-system","title":"10.

Conservation of charge is a fundamental principle: the total electric charge in an isolated system is constant. Charge can move between objects or change form (e.g., creating electron-positron pairs requires energy from outside the system), but the net charge cannot change. This principle is essential for understanding electrical phenomena.</p> <p>Concept Tested: Conservation of Charge</p> <p>See: Chapter 12 - Electric Charge and Electric Fields</p>"},{"location":"learning-graph/","title":"Learning Graph for High School Physics Course","text":"<p>This section contains the learning graph for this textbook.

A learning graph is      a graph of concepts used in this textbook. Each concept is represented by a      node in a network graph. Concepts are connected by directed edges that indicate      what concepts each node depends on before that concept is understood by the student.      A learning graph is the foundational data structure for intelligent textbooks that can recommend learning paths.      A learning graph is like a roadmap of concepts to help students arrive at their learning goals.      \u2026 +75 lines (ctrl+o to expand)</p> <p>\u23fa Perfect!

A learning graph is      a graph of concepts used in this textbook. Each concept is represented by a      node in a network graph. Concepts are connected by directed edges that indicate      what concepts each node depends on before that concept is understood by the student.      A learning graph is the foundational data structure for intelligent textbooks that can recommend learning paths.      A learning graph is like a roadmap of concepts to help students arrive at their learning goals.      \u2026 +75 lines (ctrl+o to expand)</p> <p>\u23fa Perfect!

You'll learn the scientific method for conducting      experiments and analyzing data, master the measurement systems and unit conversions critical for quantitative analysis, and      develop proficiency with mathematical tools including vectors, trigonometry, and graphical analysis. These foundational      skills form the basis for understanding all subsequent physics concepts and enable you to approach problems systematically      and quantitatively. By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to perform accurate measurements, analyze experimental errors,       work confidently with vector quantities, and interpret scientific graphs.      ## Concepts Covered      This chapter covers the following 19 concepts from the learning graph:      \u2026 +28 lines (ctrl+o to expand)</p> <p>\u23fa Write(docs/chapters/02-motion-one-dimension/index.md)   \u23bf \u00a0Wrote 32 lines to docs/chapters/02-motion-one-dimension/index.md                                                                # Motion in One Dimension      ## Summary      This chapter introduces kinematics, the study of motion without considering its causes. You'll learn to describe and analyze      motion in one dimension using position, displacement, velocity, and acceleration. Through position-time, velocity-time, and      acceleration-time graphs, you'll develop visual and analytical skills for understanding motion patterns. The kinematic      equations you master here will enable you to solve complex motion problems involving both uniform motion and uniformly      accelerated motion, providing the foundation for understanding all types of mechanical motion in physics.      ## Concepts Covered      This chapter covers the following 11 concepts from the learning graph:      \u2026 +22 lines (ctrl+o to expand)</p> <p>\u23fa Write(docs/chapters/03-motion-two-dimensions/index.md)   \u23bf \u00a0Wrote 28 lines to docs/chapters/03-motion-two-dimensions/index.md                                                               # Motion in Two Dimensions      ## Summary      This chapter extends your understanding of motion from one dimension to two dimensions, where motion occurs in a plane.      You'll apply vector decomposition and trigonometry to analyze projectile motion, from horizontally launched objects to angled       trajectories like those of kicked soccer balls or launched rockets. Free fall is examined as a special case of accelerated      motion, and you'll explore how observers in different reference frames perceive relative velocities. These skills are      essential for understanding real-world motion, which rarely occurs along a single straight line.      ## Concepts Covered      This chapter covers the following 6 concepts from the learning graph:      \u2026 +18 lines (ctrl+o to expand)</p> <p>\u23fa Write(docs/chapters/04-forces-newtons-laws/index.md)   \u23bf \u00a0Wrote 35 lines to docs/chapters/04-forces-newtons-laws/index.md                                                                 # Forces and Newton's Laws      ## Summary      This chapter introduces the fundamental principles of dynamics by exploring the relationship between forces and motion.      You'll learn Isaac Newton's three laws of motion, which form the cornerstone of classical mechanics. Starting with the      concept of force as a vector quantity, you'll discover how net force determines acceleration, why objects resist changes in      motion through inertia, and how action-reaction pairs arise in all interactions. The concepts of equilibrium\u2014both static and      dynamic\u2014will help you understand when objects remain at rest or move with constant velocity despite experiencing multiple      forces.      ## Concepts Covered      This chapter covers the following 13 concepts from the learning graph:      \u2026 +25 lines (ctrl+o to expand)</p> <p>\u23fa Write(docs/chapters/05-applications-newtons-laws/index.md)   \u23bf \u00a0Wrote 34 lines to docs/chapters/05-applications-newtons-laws/index.md                                                           # Applications of Newton's Laws      ## Summary      This chapter applies Newton's laws to a variety of real-world scenarios, developing your problem-solving skills through      increasingly complex situations. You'll analyze friction forces that oppose motion, solve problems involving tension in ropes       and cables, and master inclined plane problems using force decomposition. Pulley systems including the Atwood machine      provide opportunities to practice applying Newton's second law to connected objects. Finally, you'll explore circular motion      and learn why centripetal force and centripetal acceleration are necessary to maintain curved paths, including the physics of       banked curves on highways and racetracks.      ## Concepts Covered      This chapter covers the following 11 concepts from the learning graph:      \u2026 +24 lines (ctrl+o to expand)</p> <p>\u23fa Write(docs/chapters/06-work-energy-power/index.md)   \u23bf \u00a0Wrote 38 lines to docs/chapters/06-work-energy-power/index.md                                                                   # Work, Energy, and Power      ## Summary      This chapter introduces one of physics' most powerful concepts: energy and its conservation. You'll learn how forces do work      to transfer energy, and how energy transforms between kinetic energy (energy of motion) and potential energy (stored energy).       The work-energy theorem provides an alternative approach to solving mechanics problems, often simpler than using Newton's      laws directly. You'll distinguish between conservative and non-conservative forces, analyze energy transformations using      diagrams, and explore power as the rate of energy transfer. Simple machines demonstrate how mechanical advantage can amplify      forces, though energy conservation always applies. These energy principles will reappear throughout the rest of physics.      ## Concepts Covered      This chapter covers the following 15 concepts from the learning graph:</p> <pre><code> \u2026 +28 lines (ctrl+o to expand)\n</code></pre> <p>\u23fa Write(docs/chapters/07-momentum-collisions/index.md)   \u23bf \u00a0Wrote 34 lines to docs/chapters/07-momentum-collisions/index.md                                                                 # Momentum and Collisions      ## Summary      This chapter introduces momentum, a vector quantity that describes the \"quantity of motion\" an object possesses. You'll      discover how impulse (force applied over time) changes momentum, and learn one of physics' most important principles:      conservation of momentum in isolated systems. This conservation law enables you to analyze collisions\u2014elastic collisions      where kinetic energy is conserved, and inelastic collisions where it is not. You'll solve collision problems in both one and      two dimensions, understand how the center of mass moves for systems of objects, and explore rocket propulsion as a dramatic      application of momentum conservation through Newton's third law.      ## Concepts Covered      This chapter covers the following 10 concepts from the learning graph:      \u2026 +24 lines (ctrl+o to expand)</p> <p>\u23fa Write(docs/chapters/08-rotational-motion/index.md)   \u23bf \u00a0Wrote 35 lines to docs/chapters/08-rotational-motion/index.md                                                                   # Rotational Motion and Angular Momentum      ## Summary      This chapter extends the concepts of linear mechanics to rotational motion, revealing beautiful parallels between      translational and rotational quantities. Angular displacement, velocity, and acceleration describe rotational kinematics,      while torque (the rotational analog of force) causes angular acceleration. You'll discover that an object's resistance to      rotational acceleration depends on its rotational inertia, which varies with mass distribution. Rotational kinetic energy and       angular momentum complete the rotational analogs of linear mechanics. The conservation of angular momentum explains      phenomena from spinning figure skaters to orbiting planets, and rolling motion combines both translational and rotational      motion in a single framework.      ## Concepts Covered      This chapter covers the following 10 concepts from the learning graph:      \u2026 +25 lines (ctrl+o to expand)</p> <p>\u23fa Write(docs/chapters/09-oscillations/index.md)   \u23bf \u00a0Wrote 39 lines to docs/chapters/09-oscillations/index.md                                                                        # Oscillations and Periodic Motion      ## Summary      This chapter explores periodic motion, where objects repeat the same motion pattern over time. Simple harmonic motion (SHM)      is the most fundamental type of oscillation, characterized by a restoring force proportional to displacement. You'll analyze      SHM using amplitude, period, frequency, and angular frequency, and study two classic oscillating systems: springs obeying      Hooke's Law and pendulums swinging under gravity. Real oscillations experience damping due to non-conservative forces like      friction and air resistance. When external forces drive oscillations at specific frequencies, resonance can occur with      dramatic effects\u2014from shattering wine glasses to destroying bridges. These principles apply throughout physics and      engineering.      ## Concepts Covered      This chapter covers the following 14 concepts from the learning graph:      \u2026 +29 lines (ctrl+o to expand)</p> <p>\u23fa Write(docs/chapters/10-waves-sound/index.md)   \u23bf \u00a0Wrote 55 lines to docs/chapters/10-waves-sound/index.md                                                                         # Waves and Sound      ## Summary      This chapter explores mechanical waves\u2014disturbances that propagate through a medium, transferring energy without transferring       matter. You'll distinguish between transverse waves (where particles oscillate perpendicular to wave motion) and      longitudinal waves (where particles oscillate parallel to wave motion), and characterize waves using wavelength, frequency,      period, and wave speed. Wave interference creates constructive and destructive patterns explained by the superposition      principle, and reflection leads to standing waves with nodes and antinodes. Waves also exhibit refraction (bending when      changing media) and diffraction (spreading around obstacles). The Doppler effect describes frequency shifts for moving      sources or observers. Sound waves exemplify all these principles, with additional properties including intensity measured in      decibels, pitch related to frequency, and phenomena like beats, harmonics, and acoustic resonance that shape the music and      sounds around us.      ## Concepts Covered      This chapter covers the following 30 concepts from the learning graph:      \u2026 +45 lines (ctrl+o to expand)</p> <p>\u23fa Write(docs/chapters/11-light-optics/index.md)   \u23bf \u00a0Wrote 58 lines to docs/chapters/11-light-optics/index.md                                                                        # Light and Optics      ## Summary      This chapter explores light as an electromagnetic wave and examines how it interacts with matter. You'll study the      electromagnetic spectrum from radio waves to gamma rays, focusing on the visible spectrum humans can perceive. Light's      reflection follows precise laws that govern mirrors\u2014from simple plane mirrors to curved spherical mirrors (concave and      convex) analyzed using mirror equations and ray diagrams. Refraction occurs when light changes media, described by Snell's      Law and the index of refraction, and leads to total internal reflection at critical angles. Lenses (convex and concave)      refract light to form real and virtual images, analyzed using lens equations, thin lens formulas, and ray diagrams with focal       lengths. Dispersion separates white light into colors through prisms, explaining rainbows and related phenomena. Color      addition and subtraction describe how we perceive color. Light also exhibits wave properties through optical diffraction in      Young's double slit experiment, single slit diffraction, and diffraction gratings. Finally, polarization demonstrates light's       transverse wave nature. This comprehensive treatment reveals light's dual nature and practical applications in optics.      ## Concepts Covered      This chapter covers the following 41 concepts from the learning graph:</p> <pre><code> \u2026 +48 lines (ctrl+o to expand)\n</code></pre> <p>\u23fa Write(docs/chapters/12-electric-charge-fields/index.md)   \u23bf \u00a0Wrote 43 lines to docs/chapters/12-electric-charge-fields/index.md                                                              # Electric Charge and Electric Fields      ## Summary      This chapter introduces electrostatics, the study of electric charges at rest and the forces they exert. You'll discover that       charge comes in two types\u2014positive and negative\u2014and is conserved in all processes. Materials are classified as conductors,      insulators, semiconductors, or superconductors based on how easily charge flows through them. Charge can be transferred      through friction, contact, or induction, and grounding provides a path for excess charge to dissipate. Coulomb's Law      quantifies the electric force between charges, analogous to Newton's law of gravitation. This force can be visualized using      the electric field concept, represented by electric field lines and characterized by field strength. Moving charges in      electric fields involves electric potential energy, which leads to the concepts of electric potential and voltage\u2014the energy      per unit charge. These foundational concepts in electricity underlie all electronic technology and prepare you for deeper      study of circuits and electromagnetism.      ## Concepts Covered      This chapter covers the following 20 concepts from the learning graph:      \u2026 +33 lines (ctrl+o to expand)</p> <p>\u23fa Now let me update the mkdocs.yml navigation to include the chapters:</p> <p>\u23fa Read(mkdocs.yml)   \u23bf \u00a0Read 70 lines</p> <p>\u23fa Update(mkdocs.yml)   \u23bf \u00a0Updated mkdocs.yml with 14 additions                                                                          9    nav:        10      - Home: index.md        11      - Course Description: course-description.md        12 +    - Chapters:        13 +      - Overview: chapters/index.md        14 +      - Chapter 1 - Scientific Foundations: chapters/01-scientific-foundations/index.md        15 +      - Chapter 2 - Motion in One Dimension: chapters/02-motion-one-dimension/index.md        16 +      - Chapter 3 - Motion in Two Dimensions: chapters/03-motion-two-dimensions/index.md        17 +      - Chapter 4 - Forces and Newton's Laws: chapters/04-forces-newtons-laws/index.md        18 +      - Chapter 5 - Applications of Newton's Laws: chapters/05-applications-newtons-laws/index.md        19 +      - Chapter 6 - Work, Energy, and Power: chapters/06-work-energy-power/index.md        20 +      - Chapter 7 - Momentum and Collisions: chapters/07-momentum-collisions/index.md        21 +      - Chapter 8 - Rotational Motion: chapters/08-rotational-motion/index.md        22 +      - Chapter 9 - Oscillations: chapters/09-oscillations/index.md        23 +      - Chapter 10 - Waves and Sound: chapters/10-waves-sound/index.md        24 +      - Chapter 11 - Light and Optics: chapters/11-light-optics/index.md        25 +      - Chapter 12 - Electric Charge and Fields: chapters/12-electric-charge-fields/index.md        26      - Learning Graph:        27        - Introduction: learning-graph/index.md        28        - Concept List: learning-graph/concept-list.md</p> <p>\u23fa Perfect! Now let me update the todo list and provide the final summary:</p> <p>\u23fa Chapter Structure Generated Successfully!</p> <p>I've successfully created a complete 12-chapter structure for your high school physics textbook. Here's what was generated:</p> <p>Created Files and Directories:</p> <p>Main chapter index:   - docs/chapters/index.md - Overview of all 12 chapters with navigation links</p> <p>Individual chapter directories and index files:   1. docs/chapters/01-scientific-foundations/index.md (19 concepts)   2. docs/chapters/02-motion-one-dimension/index.md (11 concepts)   3. docs/chapters/03-motion-two-dimensions/index.md (6 concepts)   4. docs/chapters/04-forces-newtons-laws/index.md (13 concepts)   5. docs/chapters/05-applications-newtons-laws/index.md (11 concepts)   6. docs/chapters/06-work-energy-power/index.md (15 concepts)   7. docs/chapters/07-momentum-collisions/index.md (10 concepts)   8. docs/chapters/08-rotational-motion/index.md (10 concepts)   9. docs/chapters/09-oscillations/index.md (14 concepts)   10. docs/chapters/10-waves-sound/index.md (30 concepts)   11. docs/chapters/11-light-optics/index.md (41 concepts)   12. docs/chapters/12-electric-charge-fields/index.md (20 concepts)</p> <p>Updated configuration:   - mkdocs.yml - Added complete Chapters section to navigation menu</p> <p>Next Steps:</p> <ol> <li>Review the chapter structure: Run mkdocs serve to preview the site locally</li> <li>Navigate to the Chapters section to see all chapter outlines</li> <li>Use the chapter-content-generator skill (when ready) to populate each chapter with detailed content</li> <li>Each chapter index.md currently has \"TODO: Generate Chapter Content\" as a placeholder</li> </ol> <p>Statistics:</p> <ul> <li>Total chapters: 12</li> <li>Total concepts assigned: 200</li> <li>All dependencies respected: \u2713</li> <li>All concept IDs from learning-graph.json matched: \u2713</li> <li>Navigation structure updated: \u2713</li> </ul> <p>The chapter structure is now ready for content generation. Each chapter includes a summary, complete concept list, and   prerequisite references to guide the learning progression.</p> <p>how many tokens were used duing this step? </p> <p>\u23fa Based on the token usage warnings throughout this session, here's the breakdown:</p> <p>Starting tokens available: 200,000</p> <p>Final tokens remaining: 141,640</p> <p>Total tokens used: 58,360 tokens</p> <p>This represents approximately 29.2% of the available token budget for this session.</p> <p>The majority of tokens were used for:   1. Reading the learning graph JSON file (2,249 lines with all 200 concepts and their dependencies)   2. Reading the course description (435 lines)   3. Analyzing dependencies and designing the chapter structure   4. Generating 13 markdown files (1 main index + 12 chapter index files)   5. Updating the mkdocs.yml configuration</p> <p>This was a fairly efficient use of tokens considering the complexity of analyzing 200 concepts with their dependency   relationships and generating a complete chapter structure with detailed summaries and concept mappings.</p>"},{"location":"prompts/06-mermaid-scientific-method/","title":"Run the mermaid-generator skill on the Scientific Method","text":"<p>Claude Code v2.0.36            Sonnet 4.5 \u00b7 Claude Pro</p> <p>Prompt</p> <p>Run the mermaid generator on this text and put the iframe reference to it in chapter</p> <p>\u23fa I'll help you run the mermaid generator to create a diagram and add an iframe reference to chapter 1.
