# Oscillations and Periodic Motion

## Summary

This chapter explores periodic motion, where objects repeat the same motion pattern over time. Simple harmonic motion (SHM) is the most fundamental type of oscillation, characterized by a restoring force proportional to displacement. You'll analyze SHM using amplitude, period, frequency, and angular frequency, and study two classic oscillating systems: springs obeying Hooke's Law and pendulums swinging under gravity. Real oscillations experience damping due to non-conservative forces like friction and air resistance. When external forces drive oscillations at specific frequencies, resonance can occur with dramatic effects—from shattering wine glasses to destroying bridges. These principles apply throughout physics and engineering.
