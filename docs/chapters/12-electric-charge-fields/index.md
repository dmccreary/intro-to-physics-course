# Electric Charge and Electric Fields

## Summary

This chapter introduces electrostatics, the study of electric charges at rest and the forces they exert. You'll discover that charge comes in two types—positive and negative—and is conserved in all processes. Materials are classified as conductors, insulators, semiconductors, or superconductors based on how easily charge flows through them. Charge can be transferred through friction, contact, or induction, and grounding provides a path for excess charge to dissipate. Coulomb's Law quantifies the electric force between charges, analogous to Newton's law of gravitation. This force can be visualized using the electric field concept, represented by electric field lines and characterized by field strength. Moving charges in electric fields involves electric potential energy, which leads to the concepts of electric potential and voltage—the energy per unit charge. These foundational concepts in electricity underlie all electronic technology and prepare you for deeper study of circuits and electromagnetism.
