# Applications of Newton's Laws

## Summary

This chapter applies Newton's laws to a variety of real-world scenarios, developing your problem-solving skills through increasingly complex situations. You'll analyze friction forces that oppose motion, solve problems involving tension in ropes and cables, and master inclined plane problems using force decomposition. Pulley systems including the Atwood machine provide opportunities to practice applying Newton's second law to connected objects. Finally, you'll explore circular motion and learn why centripetal force and centripetal acceleration are necessary to maintain curved paths, including the physics of banked curves on highways and racetracks.
