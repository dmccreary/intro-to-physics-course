### Question 1: Electric Current
**Concept: Electric Current | Bloom's Level: Remembering**

What is the SI unit of electric current?

- A) Volt (V)
- B) Ohm (Ω)
- C) Ampere (A)
- D) Watt (W)

??? answer
    **C) Ampere (A)**

    Electric current is measured in amperes (A), where 1 ampere equals 1 coulomb of charge flowing past a point per second (1 A = 1 C/s).

### Question 2: Current Direction
**Concept: Conventional Current vs Electron Flow | Bloom's Level: Understanding**

In a simple circuit with a battery and resistor, conventional current flows:

- A) From negative terminal through the circuit to positive terminal
- B) From positive terminal through the circuit to negative terminal
- C) In both directions simultaneously
- D) Only when the circuit is open

??? answer
    **B) From positive terminal through the circuit to negative terminal**

    Conventional current is defined as the direction positive charges would flow—from positive to negative terminal. This is opposite to the actual electron flow (negative to positive), but both conventions give the same results for circuit analysis.

### Question 3: Ohm's Law Calculation
**Concept: Ohm's Law | Bloom's Level: Applying**

A 6V battery is connected to a resistor, and 0.02 A of current flows. What is the resistance?

- A) 0.12 Ω
- B) 3 Ω
- C) 120 Ω
- D) 300 Ω

??? answer
    **D) 300 Ω**

    Using Ohm's Law: R = V/I = 6 V / 0.02 A = 300 Ω

---

### Question 4: Resistance Factors
**Concept: Resistance | Bloom's Level: Understanding**

Which change would DECREASE the resistance of a copper wire?

- A) Making the wire longer
- B) Making the wire thinner
- C) Increasing the temperature
- D) Making the wire thicker

??? answer
    **D) Making the wire thicker**

    Resistance is inversely proportional to cross-sectional area (R ∝ 1/A). A thicker wire has more area for electrons to flow through, reducing resistance. Longer wires, thinner wires, and higher temperatures all increase resistance.

---

### Question 5: Power Calculation
**Concept: Electric Power | Bloom's Level: Applying**

A device operates at 12V and draws 2A of current. How much power does it consume?

- A) 6 W
- B) 14 W
- C) 24 W
- D) 144 W

??? answer
    **C) 24 W**

    Power = V × I = 12 V × 2 A = 24 W

---

### Question 6: Series Circuit
**Concept: Series Circuits | Bloom's Level: Applying**

Three 100 Ω resistors are connected in series to a 9V battery. What is the current through each resistor?

- A) 0.01 A
- B) 0.03 A
- C) 0.09 A
- D) 0.30 A

??? answer
    **B) 0.03 A**

    In a series circuit, total resistance = 100 + 100 + 100 = 300 Ω. Current = V/R = 9V / 300Ω = 0.03 A. In series, the same current flows through all components.

---

### Question 7: Parallel Circuit
**Concept: Parallel Circuits | Bloom's Level: Analyzing**

Two resistors of 100 Ω and 200 Ω are connected in parallel. What is their equivalent resistance?

- A) 50 Ω
- B) 66.7 Ω
- C) 150 Ω
- D) 300 Ω

??? answer
    **B) 66.7 Ω**

    For parallel resistors: 1/R_total = 1/R₁ + 1/R₂ = 1/100 + 1/200 = 3/200

    R_total = 200/3 = 66.7 Ω

    The equivalent resistance of parallel resistors is always less than the smallest individual resistor.

---

### Question 8: Capacitor Energy Storage
**Concept: Capacitance | Bloom's Level: Applying**

A 100 μF capacitor is charged to 10V. How much energy is stored?

- A) 0.005 J
- B) 0.01 J
- C) 0.5 J
- D) 1.0 J

??? answer
    **A) 0.005 J**

    Energy = ½CV² = ½ × (100 × 10⁻⁶ F) × (10 V)² = ½ × 0.0001 × 100 = 0.005 J = 5 mJ

---

### Question 9: Capacitor Charging Behavior
**Concept: RC Circuits | Bloom's Level: Understanding**

When charging a capacitor through a resistor, the current:

- A) Remains constant throughout charging
- B) Starts at zero and increases exponentially
- C) Starts at maximum and decreases exponentially
- D) Oscillates between positive and negative values

??? answer
    **C) Starts at maximum and decreases exponentially**

    When charging begins, the uncharged capacitor acts like a short circuit, allowing maximum current (I = V/R). As the capacitor charges, its voltage rises, opposing the battery voltage, so current decreases exponentially toward zero.

---

### Question 10: Inductor Behavior
**Concept: Inductance | Bloom's Level: Understanding**

An inductor opposes changes in:

- A) Voltage across it
- B) Current through it
- C) Temperature
- D) Resistance

??? answer
    **B) Current through it**

    Inductors oppose changes in current by generating a voltage (back-EMF) proportional to the rate of current change: V = L(dI/dt). This is electromagnetic inertia.

---

### Question 11: DC vs AC
**Concept: DC and AC Power Sources | Bloom's Level: Understanding**

Which statement correctly describes AC power?

- A) Current flows in only one direction
- B) Voltage remains constant over time
- C) Current periodically reverses direction
- D) It cannot be used to power motors

??? answer
    **C) Current periodically reverses direction**

    Alternating current (AC) periodically reverses direction, typically following a sinusoidal pattern. This is different from DC, where current flows continuously in one direction.

---

### Question 12: Battery Capacity
**Concept: Batteries | Bloom's Level: Applying**

A 3.7V lithium-ion battery has a capacity of 2000 mAh. How much energy (in watt-hours) can it store?

- A) 540 Wh
- B) 7.4 Wh
- C) 0.74 Wh
- D) 74 Wh

??? answer
    **B) 7.4 Wh**

    Energy = Voltage × Capacity = 3.7 V × 2 Ah = 7.4 Wh

    (Note: 2000 mAh = 2 Ah)

---

### Question 13: Solar Cell Operation
**Concept: Solar Cells | Bloom's Level: Understanding**

Solar cells convert light energy to electrical energy using:

- A) The thermoelectric effect
- B) The photovoltaic effect
- C) Electromagnetic induction
- D) Chemical reactions

??? answer
    **B) The photovoltaic effect**

    Solar cells use the photovoltaic effect, where photons striking a semiconductor material (usually silicon) knock electrons loose, creating an electric current.

### Question 14: Solar System Design
**Concept: Solar Battery Systems | Bloom's Level: Analyzing**

A solar lighting system uses 10W for 5 hours each night. With 4 peak sun hours available and 80% system efficiency, what minimum solar panel wattage is needed?

- A) 10 W
- B) 12.5 W
- C) 15.6 W
- D) 50 W

??? answer
    **C) 15.6 W**

    Daily energy needed = 10 W × 5 h = 50 Wh

    With 80% efficiency: 50 Wh / 0.8 = 62.5 Wh needed from panel

    With 4 peak sun hours: 62.5 Wh / 4 h = 15.6 W minimum

---

### Question 15: Motor Speed Control
**Concept: Electric Motors | Bloom's Level: Understanding**

In a DC motor, increasing the applied voltage will:

- A) Decrease the motor speed
- B) Increase the motor speed
- C) Increase the resistance
- D) Have no effect on speed

??? answer
    **B) Increase the motor speed**

    DC motor speed is approximately proportional to applied voltage. Higher voltage creates a stronger magnetic force on the armature, causing it to spin faster. Speed ≈ (V - IR)/k, where k is the motor constant.

---

### Question 16: Motor Back-EMF
**Concept: Electric Motors | Bloom's Level: Analyzing**

A DC motor runs at 1500 RPM with 12V applied, drawing 1A, and has an armature resistance of 2Ω. What is the back-EMF?

- A) 2 V
- B) 10 V
- C) 12 V
- D) 14 V

??? answer
    **B) 10 V**

    Using V = IR + E_back:

    12 V = (1 A)(2 Ω) + E_back

    E_back = 12 - 2 = 10 V

    The back-EMF opposes the applied voltage and is generated by the motor's rotation.

---

### Question 17: Kirchhoff's Current Law
**Concept: Kirchhoff's Laws | Bloom's Level: Applying**

At a junction in a circuit, three wires carry currents of 2A, 3A, and 1A into the junction. A fourth wire carries current out. What current flows in the fourth wire?

- A) 0 A
- B) 2 A
- C) 4 A
- D) 6 A

??? answer
    **D) 6 A**

    Kirchhoff's Current Law states that the sum of currents entering a junction equals the sum leaving. Current in = 2 + 3 + 1 = 6 A, so current out = 6 A.

---

### Question 18: Energy Cost
**Concept: Electric Power and Energy | Bloom's Level: Applying**

An electric heater uses 1500 W. If electricity costs $0.12 per kWh, how much does it cost to run the heater for 8 hours?

- A) $0.96
- B) $1.44
- C) $12.00
- D) $14.40

??? answer
    **B) $1.44**

    Energy = 1.5 kW × 8 h = 12 kWh

    Cost = 12 kWh × $0.12/kWh = $1.44

---

### Question 19: Time Constant
**Concept: RC Circuits | Bloom's Level: Analyzing**

An RC circuit has R = 10 kΩ and C = 100 μF. What is the time constant, and approximately how long does it take to fully charge the capacitor?

- A) τ = 0.1 s, full charge ≈ 0.5 s
- B) τ = 1 s, full charge ≈ 5 s
- C) τ = 10 s, full charge ≈ 50 s
- D) τ = 100 s, full charge ≈ 500 s

??? answer
    **B) τ = 1 s, full charge ≈ 5 s**

    Time constant τ = RC = (10 × 10³ Ω)(100 × 10⁻⁶ F) = 1 s

    A capacitor is considered fully charged after about 5 time constants (5τ), when it reaches 99.3% of final voltage.

---

### Question 20: System Integration
**Concept: Solar-Motor Systems | Bloom's Level: Evaluating**

A solar-powered water pump system has a 50W panel, charges a 12V 20Ah battery, and runs a 15W pump. On a day with 5 hours of sun, approximately how many hours can the pump run after sunset?

- A) 3 hours
- B) 6 hours
- C) 10 hours
- D) 16 hours

??? answer
    **D) 16 hours**

    Energy harvested: 50 W × 5 h = 250 Wh

    Battery capacity: 12 V × 20 Ah = 240 Wh

    Assuming the battery starts near full and can discharge to 50%:
    Available energy ≈ 240 Wh (fully charged during day)

    Pump runtime = 240 Wh / 15 W = 16 hours

    (In practice, accounting for inefficiencies, it would be somewhat less.)
