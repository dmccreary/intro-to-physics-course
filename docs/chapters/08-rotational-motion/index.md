# Rotational Motion and Angular Momentum

## Summary

This chapter extends the concepts of linear mechanics to rotational motion, revealing beautiful parallels between translational and rotational quantities. Angular displacement, velocity, and acceleration describe rotational kinematics, while torque (the rotational analog of force) causes angular acceleration. You'll discover that an object's resistance to rotational acceleration depends on its rotational inertia, which varies with mass distribution. Rotational kinetic energy and angular momentum complete the rotational analogs of linear mechanics. The conservation of angular momentum explains phenomena from spinning figure skaters to orbiting planets, and rolling motion combines both translational and rotational motion in a single framework.
