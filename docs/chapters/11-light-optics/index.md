# Light and Optics

## Summary

This chapter explores light as an electromagnetic wave and examines how it interacts with matter. You'll study the electromagnetic spectrum from radio waves to gamma rays, focusing on the visible spectrum humans can perceive. Light's reflection follows precise laws that govern mirrors—from simple plane mirrors to curved spherical mirrors (concave and convex) analyzed using mirror equations and ray diagrams. Refraction occurs when light changes media, described by Snell's Law and the index of refraction, and leads to total internal reflection at critical angles. Lenses (convex and concave) refract light to form real and virtual images, analyzed using lens equations, thin lens formulas, and ray diagrams with focal lengths. Dispersion separates white light into colors through prisms, explaining rainbows and related phenomena. Color addition and subtraction describe how we perceive color. Light also exhibits wave properties through optical diffraction in Young's double slit experiment, single slit diffraction, and diffraction gratings. Finally, polarization demonstrates light's transverse wave nature. This comprehensive treatment reveals light's dual nature and practical applications in optics.
