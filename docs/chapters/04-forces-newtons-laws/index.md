# Forces and Newton's Laws

## Summary

This chapter introduces the fundamental principles of dynamics by exploring the relationship between forces and motion. You'll learn Isaac Newton's three laws of motion, which form the cornerstone of classical mechanics. Starting with the concept of force as a vector quantity, you'll discover how net force determines acceleration, why objects resist changes in motion through inertia, and how action-reaction pairs arise in all interactions. The concepts of equilibrium—both static and dynamic—will help you understand when objects remain at rest or move with constant velocity despite experiencing multiple forces.
