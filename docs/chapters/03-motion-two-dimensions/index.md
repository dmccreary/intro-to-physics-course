# Motion in Two Dimensions

## Summary

This chapter extends your understanding of motion from one dimension to two dimensions, where motion occurs in a plane. You'll apply vector decomposition and trigonometry to analyze projectile motion, from horizontally launched objects to angled trajectories like those of kicked soccer balls or launched rockets. Free fall is examined as a special case of accelerated motion, and you'll explore how observers in different reference frames perceive relative velocities. These skills are essential for understanding real-world motion, which rarely occurs along a single straight line.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 6 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Kinematic Equations
2. Free Fall
3. Projectile Motion
4. Horizontal Projection
5. Angled Projection
6. Relative Velocity

## Prerequisites

This chapter builds on concepts from:

- [Chapter 1: Scientific Foundations and Mathematical Tools](../01-scientific-foundations/index.md)
- [Chapter 2: Motion in One Dimension](../02-motion-one-dimension/index.md)
