# Motion in One Dimension

## Summary

This chapter introduces kinematics, the study of motion without considering its causes. You'll learn to describe and analyze motion in one dimension using position, displacement, velocity, and acceleration. Through position-time, velocity-time, and acceleration-time graphs, you'll develop visual and analytical skills for understanding motion patterns. The kinematic equations you master here will enable you to solve complex motion problems involving both uniform motion and uniformly accelerated motion, providing the foundation for understanding all types of mechanical motion in physics.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 11 concepts from the learning graph:
