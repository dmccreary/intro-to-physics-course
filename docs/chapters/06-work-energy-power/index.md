# Work, Energy, and Power

## Summary

This chapter introduces one of physics' most powerful concepts: energy and its conservation. You'll learn how forces do work to transfer energy, and how energy transforms between kinetic energy (energy of motion) and potential energy (stored energy). The work-energy theorem provides an alternative approach to solving mechanics problems, often simpler than using Newton's laws directly. You'll distinguish between conservative and non-conservative forces, analyze energy transformations using diagrams, and explore power as the rate of energy transfer. Simple machines demonstrate how mechanical advantage can amplify forces, though energy conservation always applies. These energy principles will reappear throughout the rest of physics.
