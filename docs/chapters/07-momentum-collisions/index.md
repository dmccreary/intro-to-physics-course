# Momentum and Collisions

## Summary

This chapter introduces momentum, a vector quantity that describes the "quantity of motion" an object possesses. You'll discover how impulse (force applied over time) changes momentum, and learn one of physics' most important principles: conservation of momentum in isolated systems. This conservation law enables you to analyze collisions—elastic collisions where kinetic energy is conserved, and inelastic collisions where it is not. You'll solve collision problems in both one and two dimensions, understand how the center of mass moves for systems of objects, and explore rocket propulsion as a dramatic application of momentum conservation through Newton's third law.
