## Chapter Overview

1. [Scientific Foundations and Mathematical Tools](01-scientific-foundations/index.md) - This chapter introduces the scientific method, measurement systems, units, error analysis, mathematical tools including vectors, and graphical analysis techniques essential for all physics study.

2. [Motion in One Dimension](02-motion-one-dimension/index.md) - This chapter covers the fundamentals of kinematics including displacement, velocity, acceleration, motion graphs, and kinematic equations for uniform and accelerated motion.

3. [Motion in Two Dimensions](03-motion-two-dimensions/index.md) - This chapter extends kinematics to two-dimensional motion including free fall, projectile motion, and relative velocity using vector components.

4. [Forces and Newton's Laws](04-forces-newtons-laws/index.md) - This chapter introduces force as a vector quantity, develops Newton's three laws of motion, and explores equilibrium, action-reaction pairs, and inertia.

5. [Applications of Newton's Laws](05-applications-newtons-laws/index.md) - This chapter applies Newton's laws to real-world situations including friction, inclined planes, pulleys, tension systems, and circular motion with centripetal forces.

6. [Work, Energy, and Power](06-work-energy-power/index.md) - This chapter develops the concepts of work, kinetic and potential energy, energy conservation, power, efficiency, and introduces simple machines.

7. [Momentum and Collisions](07-momentum-collisions/index.md) - This chapter covers linear momentum, impulse, conservation of momentum, elastic and inelastic collisions in one and two dimensions, center of mass, and rocket propulsion.

8. [Rotational Motion and Angular Momentum](08-rotational-motion/index.md) - This chapter extends mechanics to rotation including angular kinematics, torque, rotational inertia, rotational kinetic energy, angular momentum conservation, and rolling motion.

9. [Oscillations and Periodic Motion](09-oscillations/index.md) - This chapter explores simple harmonic motion, restoring forces, springs and Hooke's Law, pendulums, damping, forced oscillations, and resonance phenomena.

10. [Waves and Sound](10-waves-sound/index.md) - This chapter covers mechanical waves, wave properties, interference, standing waves, wave behaviors, the Doppler effect, sound waves, intensity, pitch, beats, and acoustic resonance.

11. [Light and Optics](11-light-optics/index.md) - This chapter explores light as an electromagnetic wave, the electromagnetic spectrum, reflection, refraction, mirrors, lenses, dispersion, color, diffraction, and polarization.

12. [Electric Charge and Electric Fields](12-electric-charge-fields/index.md) - This chapter introduces electric charge, conductors and insulators, charging methods, Coulomb's Law, electric forces, electric fields, electric potential energy, and voltage.
