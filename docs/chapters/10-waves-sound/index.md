# Waves and Sound

## Summary

This chapter explores mechanical waves—disturbances that propagate through a medium, transferring energy without transferring matter. You'll distinguish between transverse waves (where particles oscillate perpendicular to wave motion) and longitudinal waves (where particles oscillate parallel to wave motion), and characterize waves using wavelength, frequency, period, and wave speed. Wave interference creates constructive and destructive patterns explained by the superposition principle, and reflection leads to standing waves with nodes and antinodes. Waves also exhibit refraction (bending when changing media) and diffraction (spreading around obstacles). The Doppler effect describes frequency shifts for moving sources or observers. Sound waves exemplify all these principles, with additional properties including intensity measured in decibels, pitch related to frequency, and phenomena like beats, harmonics, and acoustic resonance that shape the music and sounds around us.
