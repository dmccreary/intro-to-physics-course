# About This Book

## Why I Created This Book
The story of [Michael Faraday](./stories/faraday/index.md) is a good illustration of
why this textbook is important.  Faraday had no formal mathematical education.  And
yet his ability to mentally visualize the world around him made him one of the
greatest physicist is history.  His invention of the electric motor and his
description of magnetic fields are the foundations of modern technology.  He
combined both his immense curiosity about the world with a visualization
skill he stared to developed at a young age.

In my own life, I have been also gifted with the rare ability to visualize
the world.  In my case, my gift was the ability to visualize the motion of
data through computer systems.  Specifically I can clearly visualize
how knowledge can be efficiently represented in a concept graph. But I believe this originated with my
curiosity about how current flowed from batteries to motors.  This curiosity drove
me to build by own stereo equipment when I was in high school.

Today my shop is full of many electronics projects, from simple LEDs to complex AI robots.
It has become a great joy throughout my life.
But looking back, none of these visualization skills would have been possible
without my shop full of batteries, motors, resistors, LEDs and microcontrollers.

Unfortunately, the great tragedy is that many students today only have half the equation
to be a great engineer.  They have the curiosity but they don't have access to
my shop full of electronics toys.  My hope is this book can change this.

## Why I Build This Book Now

It should be made very clear that I have several advantages that many other
people do not have:

1. I have a sincere love of physics and electronics.
2. I have the ability to visualize exactly the data structures needed to guide AI to build textbooks.
3. I have access to generative AI tools such as Claude Code.
4. I am retired and have enough savings so I have time to play around.
5. I love to help students learn.
6. I have the emotional support of friends who believe in my work.
