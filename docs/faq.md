The pace can be adjusted based on individual learning needs and prior background.

### How is this textbook structured?

The textbook is organized into 12 chapters that follow a logical progression through physics topics. It begins with Scientific Foundations (Chapter 1) establishing measurement and mathematical tools, then progresses through Motion (Chapters 2-3), Forces (Chapters 4-5), Energy and Momentum (Chapters 6-7), Rotation and Oscillations (Chapters 8-9), Waves and Sound (Chapter 10), Light and Optics (Chapter 11), and Electricity (Chapter 12). Each chapter includes concept summaries, detailed explanations, worked examples, interactive MicroSims, practice problems, and links to the learning graph showing concept dependencies.

See: [Chapters Overview](chapters/index.md)

### What is a learning graph and how do I use it?

A learning graph is a visual map showing how concepts connect and build upon each other. Each concept appears as a node, and arrows show prerequisite relationships—if concept A points to concept B, you should understand A before studying B. The learning graph helps you navigate your learning path, identify prerequisites for challenging topics, review foundational concepts when stuck, and see the big picture of how everything connects. You can explore the interactive learning graph viewer to search concepts, filter by category, and trace dependency paths.

See: [Learning Graph Introduction](learning-graph/index.md) and [Interactive Viewer](sims/graph-viewer/index.md)

### What are MicroSims?

MicroSims are interactive educational simulations embedded throughout the textbook that let you explore physics concepts hands-on. Each MicroSim allows you to manipulate variables, observe outcomes, and develop intuition about physical relationships. For example, the projectile motion simulator lets you adjust launch angle and velocity to see how trajectory changes, while the wave interference simulator shows how waves combine. MicroSims transform passive reading into active learning, making abstract concepts concrete and memorable.

See: [List of MicroSims](sims/index.md)

### How should I approach difficult concepts?

When you encounter a challenging concept, follow this systematic approach: First, check the learning graph to identify and review prerequisites you might be missing. Second, read the glossary definition for precise terminology understanding. Third, work through provided examples step-by-step before attempting problems. Fourth, use MicroSims to visualize and manipulate the concept interactively. Fifth, practice with progressively harder problems, starting with worked examples. If still struggling, review related concepts in earlier chapters, work with study partners to discuss ideas, or seek help from your instructor with specific questions prepared.

### What is Bloom's Taxonomy and why does it matter?

Bloom's Taxonomy is a framework for categorizing learning objectives into six cognitive levels: Remembering (recalling facts), Understanding (explaining concepts), Applying (using knowledge in new situations), Analyzing (drawing connections), Evaluating (making judgments), and Creating (producing original work). This course uses Bloom's Taxonomy to ensure you develop all levels of thinking, not just memorization. Assessments are distributed across these levels, with 10% Remembering, 15% Understanding, 30% Applying, 20% Analyzing, 15% Evaluating, and 10% Creating. This means you'll spend significant time solving problems, analyzing data, and designing experiments—not just recalling definitions.

See: [Course Description - Assessment Framework](course-description.md#assessment--grading-framework)

## Core Concept Questions

### What is the scientific method?

The scientific method is a systematic approach to investigating phenomena through observation, hypothesis formation, experimentation, and analysis. It typically follows these steps: (1) Observe a phenomenon or identify a question, (2) Research existing knowledge, (3) Form a hypothesis (testable prediction), (4) Design and conduct experiments, (5) Collect and analyze data, (6) Draw conclusions, and (7) Communicate results. The scientific method ensures investigations are objective, reproducible, and lead to reliable knowledge. It's not always linear—scientists often cycle back through steps as new evidence emerges. Understanding the scientific method helps you think like a physicist and conduct meaningful investigations.

**Example:** Testing whether fertilizer increases plant growth involves controlled experiments comparing treated and untreated groups, measuring growth systematically, analyzing data statistically, and drawing evidence-based conclusions.

See: [Chapter 1 - Scientific Method](chapters/01-scientific-foundations/index.md#the-scientific-method)

### What is the difference between distance and displacement?

Distance is a scalar quantity representing the total length of path traveled, regardless of direction—it only has magnitude. Displacement is a vector quantity representing the straight-line distance and direction from initial position to final position—it has both magnitude and direction. Distance is always positive or zero and accumulates along any path. Displacement can be positive, negative, or zero and depends only on start and end points. For example, running around a 400-meter track covers 400 meters of distance but results in zero displacement if you return to the start. Understanding this distinction is crucial for kinematics problems.

**Example:** Walking 3 blocks east, then 4 blocks north results in 7 blocks total distance but only 5 blocks displacement in the northeast direction.

See: [Glossary - Distance](glossary.md#distance) and [Glossary - Displacement](glossary.md#displacement)

### What is the difference between speed and velocity?

Speed is a scalar quantity representing the rate of distance covered per unit time—it has only magnitude and is always positive or zero. Velocity is a vector quantity representing the rate of displacement change with respect to time—it has both magnitude and direction and can be positive, negative, or zero depending on chosen coordinate system. A car's speedometer shows speed (60 mph) without indicating direction. Velocity includes direction (60 mph north). Objects can have constant speed but changing velocity if direction changes, as in circular motion.

**Example:** A car traveling 60 mph north has speed of 60 mph and velocity of 60 mph north. If it turns to travel 60 mph east, speed remains constant but velocity changed direction.

See: [Glossary - Speed](glossary.md#speed) and [Glossary - Velocity](glossary.md#velocity)

### What is acceleration?

Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time, measured in meters per second squared (m/s²). Since velocity is a vector, acceleration is also a vector—it has magnitude and direction. Acceleration occurs whenever velocity changes in magnitude (speeding up or slowing down) or direction (turning), or both. Positive acceleration means velocity increases in the positive direction; negative acceleration (deceleration) means velocity decreases or increases in the negative direction. Constant acceleration means velocity changes by the same amount each second, which is the basis for kinematic equations.

**Example:** When a car speeds up from rest to 60 mph, it experiences positive acceleration. When braking, it experiences negative acceleration (deceleration). When turning at constant speed, it still accelerates because velocity direction changes.

See: [Glossary - Acceleration](glossary.md#acceleration) and [Chapter 2 - Acceleration](chapters/02-motion-one-dimension/index.md)

### What are vectors and how do they differ from scalars?

Vectors are physical quantities characterized by both magnitude and direction, represented by arrows. Examples include displacement, velocity, force, and momentum. To fully specify a vector, you must state both how much (magnitude) and which way (direction). Scalars are physical quantities characterized completely by magnitude alone, without directional component. Examples include mass, temperature, speed, and energy. Mathematical operations differ: vectors add using head-to-tail method or component addition, while scalars add arithmetically. Understanding vector vs. scalar nature is essential for correctly solving physics problems.

**Example:** Force is a vector—pushing with 50 N east is different from 50 N north. Temperature is a scalar—25°C needs no direction specification.

See: [Glossary - Vectors](glossary.md#vectors) and [Glossary - Scalars](glossary.md#scalars)

### What is Newton's First Law?

Newton's First Law (Law of Inertia) states that an object maintains constant velocity (including rest) unless acted upon by a net external force. This means objects at rest stay at rest, and objects in motion continue at constant velocity in a straight line, unless forces cause changes. The law introduces inertia—the tendency of objects to resist changes in motion, proportional to mass. Newton's First Law defines what we mean by zero net force: it's the condition producing no acceleration. It seems counterintuitive because everyday objects slow down due to friction, but in frictionless environments (like space), objects truly coast forever.

**Example:** A hockey puck sliding on frictionless ice continues moving at constant velocity indefinitely without additional pushes, demonstrating Newton's First Law.

See: [Glossary - Newton's First Law](glossary.md#newtons-first-law) and [Chapter 4 - Newton's Laws](chapters/04-forces-newtons-laws/index.md)

### What is Newton's Second Law?

Newton's Second Law states that net force equals mass times acceleration, expressed as F_net = ma. This quantifies how forces cause acceleration: larger forces produce greater acceleration, while larger masses produce smaller acceleration for the same force. The law is vector equation—force and acceleration point in the same direction. It applies to any object or system where you can identify all forces acting. Newton's Second Law is the most frequently used physics equation, applicable to everything from falling apples to rocket launches. Understanding this relationship is fundamental to solving dynamics problems.

**Example:** Applying 20 N to a 5 kg object produces 4 m/s² acceleration in the force's direction (a = F/m = 20/5 = 4).

See: [Glossary - Newton's Second Law](glossary.md#newtons-second-law) and [Chapter 4 - Newton's Second Law](chapters/04-forces-newtons-laws/index.md)

### What is Newton's Third Law?

Newton's Third Law states that forces always occur in equal-magnitude, opposite-direction pairs acting on different objects. When object A exerts force on object B, object B simultaneously exerts equal and opposite force on object A. These are called action-reaction pairs. Crucially, the two forces act on different objects, so they don't cancel—they affect each object's motion separately. Newton's Third Law explains how walking works (you push back on ground, ground pushes you forward), how rockets accelerate (expelling gas backward creates forward thrust), and why all interactions are mutual.

**Example:** A rocket expels gas downward (action), while gas pushes rocket upward (reaction) with equal force, accelerating the rocket upward.

See: [Glossary - Newton's Third Law](glossary.md#newtons-third-law) and [Glossary - Action-Reaction Pairs](glossary.md#action-reaction-pairs)

### What is force?

Force is a vector quantity representing an interaction that causes or tends to cause a change in an object's motion. Forces have both magnitude (measured in newtons) and direction. Forces can be contact forces (friction, tension, normal force) that require physical touching, or field forces (gravity, electric, magnetic) that act at a distance. Net force is the vector sum of all forces acting on an object, which determines acceleration according to Newton's Second Law. Understanding forces and how to identify them through free-body diagrams is essential for analyzing motion in dynamics problems.

**Example:** Pushing a shopping cart with 50 newtons of force causes it to accelerate in the direction of the push, according to F = ma.

See: [Glossary - Force](glossary.md#force) and [Chapter 4 - Forces](chapters/04-forces-newtons-laws/index.md)

### What is work?

Work is the energy transfer accomplished by a force acting through a displacement, equal to force times parallel displacement (W = Fd cos θ, where θ is angle between force and displacement). Work is a scalar quantity measured in joules. Positive work adds energy to a system; negative work removes energy. Only force components parallel to displacement do work—perpendicular components do no work. Understanding work is fundamental to energy analysis, as it connects forces (causing motion) to energy changes (resulting from motion). Work provides an alternative to force-based analysis for solving mechanics problems.

**Example:** Lifting a 10 kg box 2 meters high requires 196 joules of work against gravity (W = mgh = 10 × 9.8 × 2 = 196 J).

See: [Glossary - Work](glossary.md#work) and [Chapter 6 - Work and Energy](chapters/06-work-energy-power/index.md)

### What is energy?

Energy is the capacity to do work or cause change. It exists in multiple forms: kinetic energy (energy of motion), potential energy (stored energy due to position or configuration), thermal energy, chemical energy, nuclear energy, and electromagnetic energy. The total energy in an isolated system remains constant (Conservation of Energy), though it transforms between forms. Energy is scalar quantity measured in joules. Understanding energy provides powerful problem-solving approach—instead of tracking forces and accelerations throughout motion, you can compare initial and final energy states. Energy concepts underlie all of physics and connect to everyday experiences.

**Example:** A roller coaster at a hill's top has maximum potential energy; at the bottom, this transforms to maximum kinetic energy, with total mechanical energy constant (ignoring friction).

See: [Chapter 6 - Energy](chapters/06-work-energy-power/index.md)

### What is kinetic energy?

Kinetic energy is energy possessed by an object due to its motion, equal to (1/2)mv² where m is mass and v is velocity. It's a scalar quantity (always positive) measured in joules. Kinetic energy depends quadratically on velocity—doubling velocity quadruples kinetic energy. This explains why high-speed crashes are so much more dangerous than low-speed ones. The Work-Energy Theorem states that net work done on an object equals its change in kinetic energy, providing an alternative to Newton's Second Law for solving problems. Kinetic energy is one component of mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential).

**Example:** A 1000 kg car traveling at 20 m/s has 200,000 joules of kinetic energy (KE = ½ × 1000 × 20² = 200,000 J) that must be dissipated to stop.

See: [Glossary - Kinetic Energy](glossary.md#kinetic-energy)

### What is potential energy?

Potential energy is energy stored in a system due to position or configuration, capable of conversion to kinetic energy. Common types include gravitational potential energy (PE = mgh near Earth's surface, where h is height) and elastic potential energy (PE = ½kx² for springs, where k is spring constant and x is displacement). Potential energy is defined only for conservative forces where work done is path-independent. Changes in potential energy equal negative work done by the associated force. Understanding potential energy allows you to analyze situations using energy conservation instead of tracking forces throughout motion.

**Example:** A 10 kg object raised 5 meters gains 490 joules of gravitational potential energy (PE = mgh = 10 × 9.8 × 5 = 490 J), which converts to kinetic energy if dropped.

See: [Glossary - Potential Energy](glossary.md#potential-energy)

### What is conservation of energy?

Conservation of Energy states that total energy in an isolated system remains constant, though it may transform between different forms. Energy cannot be created or destroyed—only converted from one form to another. For mechanical systems without friction, mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential) is conserved: E_initial = E_final, or KE_i + PE_i = KE_f + PE_f. When non-conservative forces like friction are present, mechanical energy decreases, converting to thermal energy, but total energy (including thermal) remains constant. Conservation of Energy is one of the most fundamental principles in physics, applicable from quantum mechanics to cosmology.

**Example:** A falling apple converts gravitational potential energy into kinetic energy, with total mechanical energy constant (ignoring air resistance). At any height h with velocity v: mgh + ½mv² = constant.

See: [Glossary - Conservation of Energy](glossary.md#conservation-of-energy)

### What is momentum?

Momentum is the product of an object's mass and velocity (p = mv), a vector quantity representing quantity of motion. Momentum has magnitude and direction, measured in kg·m/s. Objects with large mass or high velocity have large momentum and are hard to stop. Momentum is conserved in isolated systems—total momentum before interaction equals total momentum after (Conservation of Momentum). This makes momentum especially useful for analyzing collisions and explosions. Momentum connects to Newton's Second Law: net force equals rate of momentum change (F = dp/dt).

**Example:** A 1000 kg car traveling at 20 m/s has 20,000 kg·m/s of momentum in the direction of motion. Stopping it requires impulse equal to this momentum change.

See: [Glossary - Linear Momentum](glossary.md#linear-momentum) and [Chapter 7 - Momentum](chapters/07-momentum-collisions/index.md)

### What is conservation of momentum?

Conservation of Momentum states that total momentum in an isolated system remains constant when no external forces act. For a system of objects: p_total,initial = p_total,final, or m₁v₁i + m₂v₂i = m₁v₁f + m₂v₂f. This principle applies to collisions (objects interacting) and explosions (objects separating). Conservation of Momentum is especially powerful because it doesn't require knowing details of interaction forces—you only need initial and final states. The principle holds even when kinetic energy isn't conserved (inelastic collisions). Conservation of Momentum, along with Conservation of Energy, are the two most fundamental conservation laws in physics.

**Example:** In a collision between two billiard balls, total momentum before impact equals total momentum after impact, even though individual ball momenta change.

See: [Glossary - Conservation of Momentum](glossary.md#conservation-of-momentum)

### What is friction?

Friction is a contact force that opposes relative motion or attempted motion between surfaces. It arises from microscopic interactions between surface irregularities. There are two types: static friction prevents surfaces at rest from sliding (up to maximum value f_s,max = μ_s N), while kinetic friction opposes surfaces already sliding (f_k = μ_k N). Here μ is coefficient of friction and N is normal force. Friction is parallel to surfaces and opposes motion direction. While friction causes energy loss in many systems, it's also essential—without friction, you couldn't walk, cars couldn't turn, and nails couldn't hold boards together.

**Example:** Friction between brake pads and rotors converts a car's kinetic energy into thermal energy, causing it to slow down and stop.

See: [Glossary - Friction](glossary.md#friction) and [Chapter 5 - Friction](chapters/05-applications-newtons-laws/index.md)

### What is projectile motion?

Projectile motion is two-dimensional motion of objects launched into air, combining constant horizontal velocity with constant vertical acceleration due to gravity. Horizontal and vertical motions are independent: horizontally, velocity is constant (no acceleration); vertically, acceleration is -g = -9.8 m/s² downward. The trajectory is parabolic. To analyze projectile motion: resolve initial velocity into horizontal (v_x = v₀ cos θ) and vertical (v_y = v₀ sin θ) components, apply kinematic equations independently to each direction, and combine results. Projectile motion applies to thrown balls, kicked soccer balls, fired bullets (ignoring air resistance), and many real-world situations.

**Example:** A basketball's arc from shooter to hoop follows projectile motion—constant horizontal velocity combined with downward gravitational acceleration creates the parabolic path.

See: [Glossary - Projectile Motion](glossary.md#projectile-motion) and [Chapter 3 - Projectile Motion](chapters/03-motion-two-dimensions/index.md)

### What are waves?

Waves are disturbances that propagate through space and time, transferring energy without transferring matter. Mechanical waves require a medium (water waves, sound waves, waves on strings); electromagnetic waves don't (light, radio waves). Waves can be transverse (particle displacement perpendicular to wave direction, like light) or longitudinal (particle displacement parallel to wave direction, like sound). Key wave properties include wavelength (distance between corresponding points), frequency (oscillations per second), amplitude (maximum displacement), and wave speed (v = fλ). Waves exhibit phenomena like interference, diffraction, and reflection. Understanding waves is essential for optics, sound, and quantum mechanics.

**Example:** Ocean waves are mechanical waves requiring water as medium; they cannot travel through empty space. Particles bob up and down as wave passes, but don't travel forward with the wave.

See: [Chapter 10 - Waves](chapters/10-waves-sound/index.md) and [Glossary - Mechanical Waves](glossary.md#mechanical-waves)

### What is interference?

Interference is the combination of two or more waves occupying the same space simultaneously, following the superposition principle (net displacement equals sum of individual displacements). Constructive interference occurs when crests align with crests and troughs with troughs, producing increased amplitude. Destructive interference occurs when crests align with troughs, producing reduced or zero amplitude. Interference creates characteristic patterns (like alternating bright and dark bands in light) that prove wave nature. Interference is used in technologies like noise-canceling headphones and interferometers. Understanding interference is crucial for wave analysis and applications.

**Example:** Two speakers playing the same frequency create louder sound at positions where waves arrive in phase (constructive interference) and quieter sound where waves arrive out of phase (destructive interference).

See: [Glossary - Wave Interference](glossary.md#wave-interference)

## Technical Detail Questions

### What are SI units and why are they important?

SI (International System of Units) provides standardized base units for physical quantities, ensuring scientists worldwide can communicate precisely. The seven SI base units are: meter (length), kilogram (mass), second (time), ampere (electric current), kelvin (temperature), mole (amount of substance), and candela (luminous intensity). All other units are derived from these base units. Using SI units prevents conversion errors, facilitates international collaboration, ensures measurement consistency, and simplifies calculations (metric system uses powers of 10). While some countries use other systems (like US customary), SI is the global scientific standard.

**Example:** Speed is measured in m/s (derived from base units meter and second), force in newtons (N = kg·m/s²), and energy in joules (J = kg·m²/s²).

See: [Glossary - SI Units](glossary.md#si-units) and [Chapter 1 - SI Units](chapters/01-scientific-foundations/index.md)

### What are significant figures and why do they matter?

Significant figures are the number of digits in a measurement that carry meaningful information about precision. They communicate measurement uncertainty: more significant figures indicate higher precision. Rules: non-zero digits are always significant; zeros between non-zero digits are significant; leading zeros are not significant; trailing zeros after decimal are significant. In calculations: multiplication/division result has as many sig figs as the least precise input; addition/subtraction result rounds to the least precise decimal place. Using significant figures correctly prevents false precision—reporting more digits than your measurement justifies misleads readers about accuracy.

**Example:** Measuring 15.20 cm (four significant figures) indicates greater precision than 15 cm (two significant figures). The first measurement is certain to ±0.01 cm, the second only to ±1 cm.

See: [Glossary - Significant Figures](glossary.md#significant-figures)

### What is dimensional analysis?

Dimensional analysis is a mathematical technique using unit relationships to check equation validity and convert between measurement systems. Every physical quantity has dimensions (combinations of length L, mass M, time T, etc.). Equations must be dimensionally consistent—both sides must have same dimensions. To convert units: multiply by conversion factors (ratios equal to 1) that cancel unwanted units and introduce desired units. Dimensional analysis catches errors in equations (wrong dimensions indicate mistakes), validates derived formulas, and performs conversions systematically. It's an essential problem-solving tool throughout physics.

**Example:** Converting 60 mph to m/s: 60 miles/hr × (1609 m/mile) × (1 hr/3600 s) = 26.8 m/s. Units cancel algebraically, leaving correct result.

See: [Glossary - Dimensional Analysis](glossary.md#dimensional-analysis)

### What is the difference between precision and accuracy?

Accuracy measures how close measurements are to the true value—high accuracy means small systematic error. Precision measures how close repeated measurements are to each other—high precision means small random error. Measurements can be: (1) accurate and precise (clustered near true value), (2) precise but not accurate (clustered away from true value—systematic error), (3) accurate but not precise (scattered around true value), or (4) neither accurate nor precise. Ideal measurements are both accurate and precise. Understanding this distinction is crucial for error analysis and experimental design.

**Example:** A miscalibrated scale giving readings clustered around 105 g for a 100 g mass is precise (repeatable) but not accurate (wrong by 5 g systematically).

See: [Glossary - Precision vs Accuracy](glossary.md#precision-vs-accuracy)

### How do I add vectors?

Vectors add using two equivalent methods: (1) Graphical (head-to-tail): place second vector's tail at first vector's head, draw resultant from first tail to second head; (2) Component: resolve each vector into x and y components, add corresponding components separately (R_x = A_x + B_x, R_y = A_y + B_y), then find resultant magnitude (R = √(R_x² + R_y²)) and direction (θ = tan⁻¹(R_y/R_x)). Component method is more accurate and extends easily to three dimensions. Vector addition is commutative (order doesn't matter) but not performed like scalar addition—direction matters.

**Example:** Walking 3 m east (A = 3î) then 4 m north (B = 4ĵ) results in resultant displacement R = 5 m at 53° north of east (using Pythagorean theorem: R = √(3² + 4²) = 5).

See: [Glossary - Vector Addition](glossary.md#vector-addition)

### What are vector components?

Vector components are projections of a vector along perpendicular coordinate axes (typically x and y). For vector A at angle θ from horizontal: horizontal component A_x = A cos θ, vertical component A_y = A sin θ. Components are scalars (have + or - signs indicating direction). Any vector can be uniquely decomposed into components; conversely, components uniquely determine a vector. Component notation makes vector calculations algebraic instead of geometric. Understanding components is essential for solving projectile motion, force analysis, and any two-dimensional problem.

**Example:** A 100 N force at 30° above horizontal has horizontal component 100 cos(30°) = 86.6 N and vertical component 100 sin(30°) = 50 N.

See: [Glossary - Vector Components](glossary.md#vector-components)

### What is free fall?

Free fall is motion under the sole influence of gravity, with acceleration equal to g = 9.8 m/s² downward regardless of mass. In free fall, all objects accelerate identically—a hammer and feather fall at the same rate in vacuum (Galileo's insight, famously demonstrated on the Moon). Free fall includes: objects dropped from rest, objects thrown upward (on the way up, at peak, and on way down), and objects thrown at angles (vertical component only). Air resistance complicates real-world free fall, but is negligible for dense, compact objects at low speeds. Free fall introduces constant acceleration, basis for kinematic equations.

**Example:** A dropped hammer and feather fall at the same rate in vacuum, both accelerating at 9.8 m/s² downward, demonstrating that gravitational acceleration is mass-independent.

See: [Glossary - Free Fall](glossary.md#free-fall)

### What are kinematic equations?

Kinematic equations are a set of four equations relating displacement (Δx), initial velocity (v₀), final velocity (v), acceleration (a), and time (t) for constant acceleration motion:

1. v = v₀ + at
2. Δx = v₀t + ½at²
3. v² = v₀² + 2aΔx
4. Δx = ½(v₀ + v)t

Each equation involves four of the five variables. Choose the equation with your three knowns and one unknown. These equations apply only when acceleration is constant. They're fundamental for solving kinematics problems—one-dimensional motion, free fall, and one direction at a time in projectile motion.

**Example:** Using v² = v₀² + 2aΔx, an object starting at rest (v₀ = 0) and accelerating at 2 m/s² travels 50 meters to reach v = √(2 × 2 × 50) = 14.1 m/s.

See: [Glossary - Kinematic Equations](glossary.md#kinematic-equations)

### What is centripetal force?

Centripetal force is the net force directed toward the center of circular motion that causes an object to follow a curved path rather than traveling straight (F_c = mv²/r, where v is speed and r is radius). Centripetal means "center-seeking." It's not a new type of force—it's the net force from actual forces (tension, gravity, friction, normal force) that happens to point toward the center. Common mistake: there's no "centrifugal force" pushing outward in an inertial reference frame—that's just inertia (objects want to go straight per Newton's First Law). Understanding centripetal force is essential for analyzing circular motion.

**Example:** Earth's gravity provides the centripetal force keeping the Moon in its nearly circular orbit, constantly pulling Moon toward Earth and curving its path.

See: [Glossary - Centripetal Force](glossary.md#centripetal-force)

### What is torque?

Torque is the rotational effect of a force, equal to the product of force and perpendicular distance from rotation axis (τ = r⊥ F, or τ = rF sin θ where θ is angle between r and F). Torque measures the force's effectiveness at causing rotation, measured in N·m. Larger forces, longer lever arms, or more perpendicular application produce more torque. Torque is the rotational analog of force: just as force causes linear acceleration (F = ma), torque causes angular acceleration (τ = Iα). Understanding torque is essential for analyzing rotating systems like wheels, gears, seesaws, and wrenches.

**Example:** Applying 100 N at the end of a 0.3 m wrench produces 30 N·m of torque (τ = 0.3 × 100 = 30) to tighten a bolt. Pushing twice as far from the bolt would double the torque.

See: [Glossary - Torque](glossary.md#torque)

### What is angular velocity?

Angular velocity is the rate of change of angular displacement with respect to time, measured in radians per second (rad/s). It indicates how fast something rotates. For an object rotating with angular velocity ω: every point at radius r from axis has tangential velocity v = rω. Angular velocity is the rotational analog of linear velocity. Positive ω indicates counterclockwise rotation (by convention); negative indicates clockwise. All points on a rigid rotating object share the same angular velocity but different tangential velocities (points farther from axis move faster). Angular velocity is fundamental for rotational kinematics.

**Example:** A Ferris wheel rotating at ω = 0.1 rad/s completes one full revolution (2π radians) every 2π/0.1 = 62.8 seconds. A person 10 m from center has tangential velocity 1 m/s.

See: [Glossary - Angular Velocity](glossary.md#angular-velocity)

### What is simple harmonic motion?

Simple harmonic motion (SHM) is periodic motion where restoring force is proportional to displacement from equilibrium (F = -kx), producing sinusoidal position-time behavior. Key characteristics: motion repeats with period T, position varies as x = A cos(ωt + φ) where A is amplitude, ω is angular frequency, and φ is phase constant. Velocity and acceleration are also sinusoidal, with velocity maximum at equilibrium (x = 0) and acceleration maximum at extremes (x = ±A). SHM appears in mass-spring systems, pendulums (small angles), vibrating molecules, and many other systems. It's the simplest oscillatory motion and a foundation for understanding more complex vibrations.

**Example:** A mass on a spring oscillates with SHM, with position x = A cos(ωt) where ω = √(k/m). The motion is perfectly sinusoidal with period T = 2π/ω.

See: [Glossary - Simple Harmonic Motion](glossary.md#simple-harmonic-motion)

### What is resonance?

Resonance is the dramatic amplitude increase when driving frequency matches a system's natural frequency. Every oscillating system has natural frequencies at which it "wants" to vibrate. When driven at a natural frequency, even small periodic forces build up large amplitudes because energy adds constructively each cycle. Resonance occurs in mechanical systems (swings, bridges, buildings), acoustic systems (musical instruments, organ pipes), and electromagnetic systems (radio tuning). Resonance can be beneficial (amplifying desired signals) or destructive (causing structural failure). Understanding resonance is crucial for engineering and acoustics.

**Example:** Pushing a swing at its natural frequency causes amplitude to build dramatically with each push, demonstrating resonance. Pushing at other frequencies is much less effective.

See: [Glossary - Resonance](glossary.md#resonance)

### What is the Doppler effect?

The Doppler effect is the change in observed frequency of a wave due to relative motion between source and observer. When source and observer move closer: observed frequency increases (higher pitch for sound, blue-shift for light). When they move apart: observed frequency decreases (lower pitch, red-shift). The effect occurs for all waves but is most familiar with sound. For source moving at speed v_s toward stationary observer: f_observed = f_source × c/(c - v_s), where c is wave speed. Doppler effect applications include police radar, astronomy (measuring star velocities), and medical ultrasound.

**Example:** An ambulance siren sounds higher pitched as it approaches you (frequency increases) and lower pitched as it moves away (frequency decreases), even though the siren emits constant frequency.

See: [Glossary - Doppler Effect](glossary.md#doppler-effect)

### What is refraction?

Refraction is the bending of waves when entering a medium with different wave speed, due to wavelength change while frequency remains constant. Light slows when entering denser media (like glass or water), causing it to bend toward the normal (perpendicular to surface). Snell's Law quantifies refraction: n₁ sin θ₁ = n₂ sin θ₂, where n is index of refraction (ratio of light speed in vacuum to speed in medium) and θ is angle from normal. Refraction explains why objects underwater appear at different positions, how lenses work, and why prisms separate white light into colors (dispersion). Understanding refraction is essential for optics.

**Example:** A straw in water appears bent at the surface due to light refraction between air and water. Light changes direction at the interface because it travels at different speeds in the two media.

See: [Glossary - Refraction](glossary.md#refraction) and [Chapter 11 - Refraction](chapters/11-light-optics/index.md)

### What is the difference between real and virtual images?

Real images form where light rays actually converge—they can be projected onto screens and captured by cameras. Concave mirrors and convex lenses can form real images when object is beyond focal point. Real images are inverted (upside down). Virtual images form where light rays appear to diverge from—they cannot be projected onto screens but can be seen by looking into the optical device. Plane mirrors, convex mirrors, and concave lenses always form virtual images. Convex lenses form virtual images when object is inside focal point. Virtual images are upright. Understanding this distinction is crucial for ray tracing and image formation analysis.

**Example:** A movie projector creates real images on the screen as light rays from film converge through the lens. Your bathroom mirror reflection is a virtual image appearing behind the mirror where light rays don't actually converge.

See: [Glossary - Real Images](glossary.md#real-images) and [Glossary - Virtual Images](glossary.md#virtual-images)

### What is electric charge?

Electric charge is a fundamental property of matter that causes electromagnetic interactions, existing in positive and negative forms. Electrons carry negative charge (-1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ coulombs); protons carry equal positive charge. Like charges repel; opposite charges attract. Charge is quantized (comes in discrete packets, multiples of fundamental charge e) and conserved (total charge in isolated system never changes—charge transfers between objects but isn't created or destroyed). Charging methods include friction (rubbing), contact (touching), and induction (no contact). Understanding charge is foundational for electricity and magnetism.

**Example:** Rubbing a balloon on hair transfers electrons to balloon, leaving hair positively charged and balloon negatively charged. They attract due to opposite charges.

See: [Glossary - Electric Charge](glossary.md#electric-charge) and [Chapter 12 - Electric Charge](chapters/12-electric-charge-fields/index.md)

### What is an electric field?

An electric field is a region around charged objects where electric forces act on other charges, represented by force per unit charge (E = F/q). Electric field is a vector pointing in the direction positive test charge would be pushed. Field lines visualize electric fields: they emerge from positive charges, terminate on negative charges, and never cross. Line density indicates field strength. Electric field allows us to think about charges creating fields that then exert forces on other charges, separating the "source" from the "test" charge. Understanding electric fields is essential for analyzing electrostatic situations.

**Example:** The electric field around a positive point charge points radially outward and weakens with distance according to E = kq/r². A positive test charge placed in this field experiences outward force.

See: [Glossary - Electric Field](glossary.md#electric-field)

## Common Challenge Questions

### Why do I need to learn physics formulas instead of just looking them up?

While you can look up formulas, understanding them deeply allows you to: (1) recognize when and how to apply them, (2) identify which of multiple formulas applies to a situation, (3) manipulate equations to solve for different variables, (4) catch errors if you write formulas incorrectly, (5) understand physical relationships they represent, and (6) derive variations for novel situations. Memorization without understanding is useless—you'll misapply formulas. Deep understanding comes from working many problems, seeing connections between concepts, and recognizing patterns. The goal isn't mindless recall but internalized physical intuition that lets formulas become tools for thinking, not just calculations to perform.

### How do I know which kinematic equation to use?

Choose the kinematic equation that contains your three known variables and your one unknown. Strategy: (1) list what you know (Δx, v₀, v, a, t), (2) identify what you're solving for, (3) select the equation containing your three knowns and one unknown. The four equations are: v = v₀ + at (no Δx), Δx = v₀t + ½at² (no v), v² = v₀² + 2aΔx (no t), Δx = ½(v₀ + v)t (no a). Sometimes you'll solve one equation first to find an intermediate variable, then use a second equation for the final answer. This systematic approach works reliably—don't guess randomly or try to memorize specific scenarios.

### Why is the normal force not always equal to weight?

Normal force is the perpendicular contact force a surface exerts on an object, preventing objects from passing through each other. While N = mg for objects resting on horizontal surfaces, normal force adjusts to satisfy Newton's Second Law based on all forces and motion. Examples where N ≠ mg: (1) on inclined planes, N = mg cos θ where θ is angle, (2) in elevators accelerating upward, N > mg (feel heavier), (3) in elevators accelerating downward, N < mg (feel lighter), (4) at the top of vertical circles, N + mg provides centripetal force. The key insight: normal force is whatever value needed (along with other forces) to produce the actual acceleration. Don't assume N = mg—analyze forces carefully.

### How do I draw a free-body diagram?

A free-body diagram (FBD) shows all forces acting on ONE object, representing forces as arrows with lengths proportional to magnitudes. Steps: (1) Isolate the object—draw a dot or simple shape representing it, (2) Identify all forces acting ON the object (not BY the object), (3) Draw force vectors as arrows originating from the object, pointing in force directions, (4) Label each force (F_gravity, F_normal, F_tension, F_friction, etc.), (5) Choose coordinate system (usually x horizontal, y vertical or along/perpendicular to surfaces). Don't include motion or equal-opposite pairs (those act on different objects). FBDs are essential for applying Newton's Laws—they help you visualize forces and set up equations correctly.

### Why does an object at terminal velocity have zero acceleration but constant velocity?

Terminal velocity occurs when drag force (air resistance) increases with speed until it equals weight, making net force zero. By Newton's Second Law (F_net = ma), zero net force means zero acceleration. Zero acceleration means velocity isn't changing—it's constant. The object continues falling at constant velocity because balanced forces produce no acceleration, while the constant velocity is maintained by inertia (Newton's First Law). This illustrates the distinction between velocity and acceleration: velocity tells current motion; acceleration tells if motion is changing. Terminal velocity demonstrates dynamic equilibrium—moving at constant velocity with balanced forces.

### How can kinetic energy be lost in inelastic collisions if energy is conserved?

Energy is always conserved—it never disappears. In inelastic collisions, kinetic energy isn't lost; it transforms into other forms (primarily thermal energy and sound, possibly deformation energy). The objects heat up slightly due to friction during collision, acoustic waves carry energy away, and permanent deformations store energy in changed molecular configurations. "Kinetic energy isn't conserved" means mechanical kinetic energy specifically decreases, but total energy (kinetic + thermal + sound + deformation) remains constant. In perfectly inelastic collisions (objects stick), maximum kinetic energy converts to other forms. This distinction is crucial: momentum is always conserved (isolated system); kinetic energy is conserved only in elastic collisions; total energy is always conserved.

### Why do I need to resolve forces into components?

Component resolution (breaking forces into perpendicular x and y parts) transforms two-dimensional vector problems into two independent one-dimensional scalar problems, which are much easier to solve. It allows you to apply Newton's Second Law separately in perpendicular directions: ΣF_x = ma_x and ΣF_y = ma_y. This works because perpendicular components don't affect each other—horizontal forces don't cause vertical acceleration and vice versa. Component resolution is essential for inclined planes (resolve weight into parallel and perpendicular components), projectile motion (horizontal and vertical are independent), and any situation with forces at angles. Master this technique—it's fundamental to physics problem-solving.

### How do I analyze circular motion problems?

For uniform circular motion (constant speed around circle): (1) recognize centripetal acceleration points toward center with magnitude a_c = v²/r, (2) identify all actual forces acting on object (tension, gravity, normal, friction), (3) resolve forces into radial (toward center) and tangential (perpendicular to radius) components, (4) apply Newton's Second Law in radial direction: ΣF_radial = ma_c = mv²/r, (5) solve for unknown (often speed or tension). Don't include "centrifugal force" pointing outward—that's not a real force in inertial frames. For non-uniform circular motion (changing speed), also analyze tangential direction where tangential forces cause changes in speed. Circular motion problems become straightforward with systematic component analysis.

### Why does a pendulum's period not depend on mass?

For a simple pendulum (point mass on massless string), period T = 2π√(L/g) depends only on length L and gravitational acceleration g, not mass m. This occurs because both restoring force and inertia are proportional to mass—they cancel in the equations. Heavier masses experience stronger restoring forces (F = -mg sin θ ≈ -mgθ for small angles) but also have more inertia resisting acceleration. The ratio F/m = gθ is mass-independent. Consequence: all simple pendulums of the same length at the same location have identical periods. This beautiful result, discovered by Galileo, demonstrates how mass affects force and inertia proportionally. Note: this applies to simple pendulums; physical pendulums (extended objects) have different analysis.

### How do standing waves form?

Standing waves form through interference of waves traveling in opposite directions with the same frequency, typically from a wave and its reflection. At certain frequencies (resonant frequencies), the forward and reflected waves interfere constructively and destructively at fixed locations, creating a stationary pattern with nodes (zero amplitude points) and antinodes (maximum amplitude points). Standing waves on strings: L = nλ/2 where n = 1, 2, 3... gives resonant wavelengths. Standing waves are crucial for musical instruments: guitar strings, organ pipes, drums all vibrate at characteristic frequencies determined by their dimensions. Understanding standing waves requires grasping superposition and boundary conditions.

**Example:** A guitar string vibrates in standing wave patterns with nodes at both fixed ends and antinodes where amplitude is maximum. The fundamental (n=1) has one antinode; higher harmonics have more.

See: [Glossary - Standing Waves](glossary.md#standing-waves)

### When should I use energy methods versus force methods?

Use energy methods (Conservation of Energy, Work-Energy Theorem) when: (1) you need initial and final states without detailed path information, (2) forces vary with position (like springs), (3) motion involves transformations between kinetic and potential energy, (4) you want simpler calculations avoiding acceleration and time. Use force methods (Newton's Second Law) when: (1) you need acceleration, forces, or time information, (2) motion involves constant forces, (3) you're analyzing equilibrium (zero acceleration), (4) energy is dissipated by friction (though work by friction can be handled in energy approach). Often, problems can be solved either way—choose the method that leads to fewer steps. Many complex problems combine both approaches strategically.

## Best Practice Questions

### What problem-solving strategy should I use for physics problems?

Follow this systematic approach: (1) **Read** carefully, visualizing the situation; (2) **Sketch** a diagram showing the setup, coordinate system, and known values; (3) **List** knowns and unknowns explicitly; (4) **Plan** which principles/equations apply (kinematics, Newton's Laws, energy, momentum); (5) **Solve** algebraically first (don't plug numbers yet), manipulating equations to isolate the unknown; (6) **Calculate** using known values with units; (7) **Check** whether the answer makes physical sense (right order of magnitude, correct units, physically reasonable). This structured approach prevents careless errors, helps you learn problem patterns, and makes complex problems manageable. Don't skip to calculations—the thinking steps are most important.

### How should I approach laboratory work?

Effective laboratory work involves: (1) **Prepare** by reading lab instructions beforehand, understanding objectives and procedures; (2) **Hypothesize** predicting results before observing; (3) **Observe** carefully during experiments, taking detailed notes; (4) **Measure** systematically with appropriate precision, recording uncertainties; (5) **Analyze** data promptly while fresh in memory, creating graphs and calculating results; (6) **Compare** experimental results with theoretical predictions, explaining discrepancies; (7) **Reflect** on what worked, what didn't, and what you learned. Keep detailed lab notebooks with dates, conditions, raw data, calculations, and observations. Lab work teaches scientific method, data analysis, and how physics concepts apply practically—approach it as seriously as theoretical study.

### How can I improve my conceptual understanding?

Deepen understanding through multiple approaches: (1) **Explain** concepts aloud or in writing to others—teaching reveals gaps in understanding; (2) **Visualize** using diagrams, graphs, and MicroSims—physical intuition complements mathematical rigor; (3) **Connect** new concepts to previous learning and everyday experiences; (4) **Question** assumptions and explore edge cases (what happens if...?); (5) **Work** many problems of varying difficulty; (6) **Study** worked examples actively, covering the solution and trying yourself; (7) **Use** the learning graph to see how concepts relate. Conceptual understanding goes beyond formula manipulation—it means you can explain why methods work, predict outcomes, and apply knowledge flexibly to novel situations.

### When should I use the learning graph?

Use the learning graph: (1) **Before studying** a new chapter to identify prerequisites you should review; (2) **When stuck** on a concept to trace back to foundational ideas you might be missing; (3) **For review** to see connections between concepts and study systematically; (4) **When planning** study sessions to tackle concepts in logical order; (5) **For overview** to understand course structure and where topics fit. The learning graph shows concept dependencies—arrows point from prerequisites to dependent concepts. If struggling with a concept, check what it depends on and ensure you've mastered those first. The interactive viewer lets you search, filter by category, and explore paths through the material.

See: [Interactive Learning Graph Viewer](sims/graph-viewer/index.md)

### How do I effectively use MicroSims?

Maximize MicroSim learning value by: (1) **Predict** before manipulating—what do you expect to happen?; (2) **Observe** carefully when changing variables, noting patterns and relationships; (3) **Test** systematically varying one parameter at a time to isolate effects; (4) **Quantify** relationships when possible (doubling X doubles Y, etc.); (5) **Connect** simulations to theoretical equations—see how formulas manifest visually; (6) **Apply** to real-world scenarios mentally (how does this explain...?). Don't just play randomly—approach MicroSims as virtual labs with learning objectives. They're most effective when integrated with reading and problem-solving, not used in isolation. Come back to MicroSims after studying theory to reinforce understanding.

### How should I prepare for assessments?

Effective preparation strategies: (1) **Start early**, reviewing regularly rather than cramming—distributed practice enhances retention; (2) **Use active recall**, testing yourself instead of passively rereading; (3) **Practice problems** extensively—physics competence requires doing, not just understanding; (4) **Study conceptually**, understanding why methods work rather than memorizing procedures; (5) **Identify weak areas** through practice tests and targeted review; (6) **Create summary sheets** with key equations, concepts, and problem-solving strategies; (7) **Study with peers**, explaining concepts to each other and comparing problem approaches. On assessments, read questions carefully, draw diagrams, show work clearly, check units and reasonableness. Remember assessments span all Bloom's levels—prepare for application, analysis, and evaluation questions, not just recall.

### How do I build physical intuition?

Physical intuition—gut feeling for how systems behave—develops through: (1) **Experience** observing and interacting with physical systems in labs and daily life; (2) **Visualization** mentally simulating scenarios before calculating; (3) **Estimation** making quick order-of-magnitude predictions to catch calculation errors; (4) **Pattern recognition** seeing similarities across different problems; (5) **Limiting cases** checking what happens at extremes (very large, very small, zero); (6) **Analogies** connecting abstract concepts to familiar experiences. Strong intuition lets you catch errors, make reasonable approximations, and approach novel problems confidently. It complements mathematical rigor—trust your intuition to guide problem-solving, then verify with calculations. Intuition grows with practice and reflection.

### What's the best way to organize my physics notes?

Effective note organization: (1) **Date** entries and include chapter/topic references for easy location; (2) **Separate** class notes, reading notes, problem solutions, and lab reports; (3) **Use** consistent formatting with headings, subheadings, and visual hierarchy; (4) **Include** diagrams, graphs, and examples—not just text and equations; (5) **Highlight** key equations, definitions, and problem-solving strategies; (6) **Cross-reference** related concepts and where they connect; (7) **Leave** white space for additions and corrections; (8) **Review** and annotate notes regularly, adding insights from problem-solving. Consider digital notes for searchability or paper notes for better retention—choose what works for you. Good notes become invaluable study resources for exams and reference material for future courses.

### How can I check if my answer is reasonable?

Always perform reasonableness checks: (1) **Units**: Do units work out correctly? (2) **Sign**: Is direction (positive/negative) sensible? (3) **Magnitude**: Is the order of magnitude reasonable? (Compare to familiar values: human speeds ~1-10 m/s, car speeds ~10-30 m/s, g ≈ 10 m/s²); (4) **Limiting cases**: What happens at extremes? (If v → 0, does kinetic energy → 0?); (5) **Symmetry**: Do symmetric situations give symmetric results?; (6) **Comparison**: Does this match similar problems you've solved? Catching errors through reasonableness checks is a crucial skill—computers calculate perfectly but can't detect if you used the wrong equation or set up the problem incorrectly. Develop this habit early.

## Advanced Topic Questions

### How does conservation of energy apply when friction is present?

When friction acts, mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) isn't conserved—it decreases, converting to thermal energy. Total energy (mechanical + thermal) remains conserved. To analyze: (1) Calculate work done by friction: W_friction = -f_k × d (negative because it opposes motion); (2) Apply modified energy conservation: KE_i + PE_i + W_friction = KE_f + PE_f, where W_friction is negative; (3) Recognize that |W_friction| equals thermal energy generated. Alternatively, track total energy: E_mechanical,initial = E_mechanical,final + E_thermal. Friction problems often involve finding stopping distances, final speeds after energy loss, or heat generated. The key insight: energy never disappears—it transforms into forms (thermal, sound) not always tracked explicitly as mechanical energy.

### How do I analyze multi-object systems using conservation principles?

For systems of multiple interacting objects: (1) **Define the system** boundary including all relevant objects; (2) **Identify** whether external forces act on the system (if none, momentum is conserved); (3) **Identify** whether non-conservative forces act (if none, mechanical energy is conserved); (4) **Write** conservation equations for the entire system, not individual objects; (5) **Solve** system of equations for unknowns. Example: in collisions, momentum is always conserved if no external forces; energy is conserved only if elastic. For connected objects (Atwood machines, pulleys), use constraints (like rope length constancy) to relate motion. System analysis is powerful because it avoids tracking internal forces—they cancel in pairs per Newton's Third Law.

### How do rotational and translational motion relate in rolling?

Rolling without slipping is combined rotational and translational motion satisfying the constraint v_cm = rω, where v_cm is center of mass velocity, r is radius, and ω is angular velocity. This constraint means the contact point has zero instantaneous velocity (it's momentarily at rest relative to ground). Rolling objects have both translational kinetic energy (½mv_cm²) and rotational kinetic energy (½Iω²), so total KE = ½mv_cm² + ½Iω². When analyzing rolling down inclines, use energy conservation including both forms of kinetic energy. The rolling constraint couples translational and rotational motion—they're not independent. Objects with different mass distributions (different I) roll at different rates even with same mass and radius.

### What causes tides and how do they relate to physics concepts?

Tides arise from differential gravitational forces: the Moon's gravity is slightly stronger on Earth's near side (pulling water toward Moon) and slightly weaker on far side (Earth center pulled more than far-side water, effectively stretching). This creates two tidal bulges—one toward Moon, one away. Earth rotates under these bulges, producing two high tides and two low tides daily. Tidal forces also act on Earth itself (earth tides) and cause tidal locking (Moon always shows same face to Earth). Tides demonstrate: (1) gravitational force decreases with distance (inverse square law), (2) reference frame effects (far-side bulge seems counterintuitive), (3) system energy dissipation (tides gradually slow Earth's rotation and increase Moon's orbital distance). Solar tides also exist; spring tides occur when Sun and Moon align.

### How do waves transfer energy without transferring matter?

Waves propagate by passing energy from particle to particle through a medium (or through electromagnetic fields for EM waves). Each particle oscillates about an equilibrium position, executing simple harmonic motion, then transfers energy to neighbors. The particle itself doesn't travel with the wave—it just moves back and forth. Energy flows continuously through space while matter oscillates locally. Example: water waves appear to move water forward, but floating objects show water actually moves in circles, returning to nearly original positions. Wave speed depends on medium properties (tension, density, elasticity) that determine how quickly energy transfers between particles. Understanding this distinction is crucial: wave phenomena involve energy transport, not mass transport.

### What are the limits of classical physics?

Classical physics (Newton's Laws, Maxwell's Equations) works excellently for everyday objects moving at ordinary speeds. It fails at extremes: (1) **Very fast** (approaching light speed): Relativistic effects become important—time dilates, lengths contract, mass increases, nothing travels faster than c. Classical mechanics is replaced by special relativity; (2) **Very small** (atomic scale): Quantum effects dominate—particles behave like waves, energy is quantized, uncertainty principle applies. Classical mechanics is replaced by quantum mechanics; (3) **Very massive** (black holes, cosmology): Spacetime curvature matters. Classical gravity is replaced by general relativity. For everyday human-scale phenomena (speeds << c, sizes >> atoms), classical physics is accurate and simpler than relativistic or quantum treatments. Know when approximations apply and when they break down.

### How do conservative and non-conservative forces differ fundamentally?

Conservative forces (gravity, elastic, electric) have work path-independent—work depends only on initial and final positions, allowing potential energy definition. Moving in closed loop against conservative force returns to same energy state (zero net work). Mathematical property: conservative forces have zero curl (∇ × F = 0). Non-conservative forces (friction, air resistance, tension) have path-dependent work—work depends on specific path taken. Moving in closed loop against friction dissipates energy. You can't define potential energy for non-conservative forces because there's no unique value at each position. Physically: conservative forces store energy retrievably; non-conservative forces dissipate energy into thermal and other forms. This distinction determines when mechanical energy conservation applies.

### How would I design an experiment to measure gravitational acceleration?

Several approaches demonstrate experimental design: **Method 1** (Simple pendulum): Measure period T for various lengths L, plot T² vs. L. Slope equals 4π²/g, so g = 4π²/(slope). **Method 2** (Free fall): Drop object from measured heights h, time fall with photogate. Use h = ½gt² to find g = 2h/t². Repeat for multiple heights, plot h vs. t², slope gives ½g. **Method 3** (Inclined plane): Release cart on frictionless track at angle θ, measure acceleration a_measured. Since a = g sin θ, we get g = a/sin θ. Each method requires: controlling variables, minimizing uncertainties, collecting multiple trials, analyzing data graphically, calculating uncertainties in results. This demonstrates how physical principles enable measurement of fundamental constants.
