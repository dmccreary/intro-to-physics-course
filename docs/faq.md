See [Learning Graph Viewer](sims/graph-viewer/index.md) for interactive exploration.

## Core Concepts

### What is the scientific method?

The scientific method is a systematic approach to investigating phenomena through observation, hypothesis formation, experimentation, and analysis. It provides a structured way to ask questions and find reliable answers about the natural world. The process typically includes: observing a phenomenon, researching existing knowledge, formulating a testable hypothesis, designing and conducting experiments, analyzing data, drawing conclusions, communicating results, and refining based on feedback. The scientific method is iterative—we cycle through these steps multiple times to refine our understanding.

See [Chapter 1: Scientific Method](chapters/01-scientific-foundations/index.md#the-scientific-method-how-physicists-think) for detailed explanation and examples.

### What are SI units and why do we use them?

SI (Système International) units are the standardized international system of measurement used by scientists worldwide. The system is based on seven fundamental base units (meter, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, mole, candela) from which all other units are derived. We use SI units to ensure clear communication across languages and cultures, maintain consistency in calculations, and enable accurate comparison of experimental results. In physics, we primarily work with meters (length), kilograms (mass), and seconds (time).

See [Chapter 1: SI Units](chapters/01-scientific-foundations/index.md#si-units-the-international-standard) and [Glossary: SI Units](glossary.md#si-units).

### What is the difference between scalars and vectors?

Scalars are physical quantities that have only magnitude (size), while vectors have both magnitude and direction. Examples of scalars include temperature (20°C), mass (5 kg), time (10 seconds), and speed (30 m/s). Examples of vectors include displacement (50 m north), velocity (30 m/s eastward), force (100 N downward), and acceleration (9.8 m/s² toward Earth's center). Vectors require special mathematical operations (vector addition, components, dot and cross products) that account for their directional nature.

See [Chapter 1: Scalars and Vectors](chapters/01-scientific-foundations/index.md) and [Glossary: Scalars](glossary.md#scalars) and [Vectors](glossary.md#vectors).

### What is displacement and how is it different from distance?

Displacement is a vector quantity representing the straight-line distance and direction from a starting position to an ending position, while distance is a scalar quantity measuring the total length of the path traveled regardless of direction. For example, if you walk 3 blocks north then 4 blocks east, your distance traveled is 7 blocks, but your displacement is 5 blocks northeast (using the Pythagorean theorem). Displacement tells you where you ended up relative to where you started; distance tells you how far you walked.

See [Chapter 2: Displacement](chapters/02-motion-one-dimension/index.md) and [Glossary: Displacement](glossary.md#displacement) vs [Distance](glossary.md#distance).

### What is velocity and how does it differ from speed?

Velocity is a vector quantity describing the rate of change of position, including both speed (magnitude) and direction, while speed is a scalar quantity measuring only how fast an object moves regardless of direction. A car traveling 60 km/h northward has a velocity that fully specifies its motion, whereas speed only tells you it's moving at 60 km/h. Two cars can have the same speed but different velocities if they're traveling in different directions. Velocity can be negative (indicating direction opposite to the positive reference direction) while speed is always positive.

See [Chapter 2: Velocity](chapters/02-motion-one-dimension/index.md) and [Glossary: Velocity](glossary.md#velocity) vs [Speed](glossary.md#speed).

### What is acceleration?

Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time, measured in meters per second squared (m/s²). It describes how quickly an object's velocity is changing, which includes changes in speed, direction, or both. When a car speeds up, slows down, or turns a corner, it's accelerating. Acceleration can be positive (increasing velocity), negative (decreasing velocity, sometimes called deceleration), or perpendicular to motion (changing direction as in circular motion). Constant acceleration, like gravity near Earth's surface (9.8 m/s²), means velocity changes by the same amount each second.

See [Chapter 2: Acceleration](chapters/02-motion-one-dimension/index.md) and [Glossary: Acceleration](glossary.md#acceleration).

### What are Newton's Three Laws of Motion?

Newton's Three Laws form the foundation of classical mechanics. **First Law (Inertia):** An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with constant velocity unless acted upon by a net external force. **Second Law:** The net force on an object equals its mass times acceleration (F = ma), meaning heavier objects require more force to accelerate. **Third Law:** For every action force, there is an equal and opposite reaction force acting on a different object. These laws explain everything from why seatbelts protect you in crashes to how rockets propel through space.

See [Chapter 4: Newton's Laws](chapters/04-forces-newtons-laws/index.md) and [Glossary: Newton's First Law](glossary.md#newtons-first-law), [Second Law](glossary.md#newtons-second-law), [Third Law](glossary.md#newtons-third-law).

### What is force and how is it measured?

Force is a vector quantity representing a push or pull that can cause an object to accelerate, measured in newtons (N). One newton is the force required to accelerate a 1-kilogram object at 1 meter per second squared. Forces can be contact forces (friction, tension, normal force) that require objects to touch, or field forces (gravity, electric, magnetic) that act at a distance. The net force (vector sum of all forces) determines an object's acceleration according to Newton's Second Law. Forces are measured using devices like spring scales, force sensors, or calculated from mass and acceleration.

See [Chapter 4: Force](chapters/04-forces-newtons-laws/index.md) and [Glossary: Force](glossary.md#force).

### What is friction and why is it important?

Friction is a force that opposes the relative motion or attempted motion between surfaces in contact. It arises from microscopic irregularities where surfaces interact. There are two main types: static friction (prevents motion from starting) and kinetic friction (opposes motion once started). Friction is essential for everyday activities—walking, driving, and holding objects all depend on friction. Without friction, you couldn't walk forward (your feet would slip), cars couldn't accelerate or brake, and nothing would stay in place. However, friction also causes energy loss and wear in machines, requiring lubrication and maintenance.

See [Chapter 5: Friction](chapters/05-applications-newtons-laws/index.md) and [Glossary: Friction](glossary.md#friction), [Static Friction](glossary.md#static-friction), [Kinetic Friction](glossary.md#kinetic-friction).

### What is work in physics?

Work is the transfer of energy that occurs when a force acts on an object through a displacement in the direction of the force, measured in joules (J). Work equals force times displacement times the cosine of the angle between them: W = F·d·cos(θ). Only the component of force parallel to displacement does work. Lifting a 20-kg box 1.5 meters requires 294 joules of work against gravity. Importantly, if there's no displacement (pushing against a wall that doesn't move) or if force is perpendicular to motion (centripetal force in circular motion), zero work is done despite effort expended.

See [Chapter 6: Work](chapters/06-work-energy-power/index.md) and [Glossary: Work](glossary.md#work).

### What is energy and what forms does it take?

Energy is the capacity to do work or cause change, measured in joules. Energy exists in many forms but broadly divides into kinetic energy (energy of motion) and potential energy (stored energy due to position or configuration). Kinetic energy equals ½mv², where m is mass and v is velocity. Potential energy includes gravitational potential energy (mgh, where h is height), elastic potential energy (stored in springs and stretched materials), and electric potential energy (stored in separated charges). The Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another.

See [Chapter 6: Energy](chapters/06-work-energy-power/index.md) and [Glossary: Kinetic Energy](glossary.md#kinetic-energy), [Potential Energy](glossary.md#potential-energy).

### What is momentum?

Momentum is the product of an object's mass and velocity, representing its quantity of motion, measured in kg·m/s. A 2-kg ball moving at 5 m/s has momentum of 10 kg·m/s. Momentum is a vector quantity pointing in the direction of velocity. Heavy objects moving fast have large momentum and are difficult to stop. The Law of Conservation of Momentum states that in an isolated system (no external forces), total momentum remains constant. This explains why in collisions between billiard balls, the total momentum before impact equals the total momentum after.

See [Chapter 7: Momentum](chapters/07-momentum-collisions/index.md) and [Glossary: Linear Momentum](glossary.md#linear-momentum).

### What are collisions and what types exist?

Collisions are interactions where two or more objects exert forces on each other for a short time. **Elastic collisions** conserve both momentum and kinetic energy—objects bounce apart with no energy loss (billiard balls approximate this). **Inelastic collisions** conserve momentum but not kinetic energy—some energy converts to heat, sound, or deformation (car crashes). **Perfectly inelastic collisions** occur when objects stick together after impact, losing maximum kinetic energy while still conserving momentum (railroad cars coupling). All collision types obey conservation of momentum, but only elastic collisions conserve kinetic energy.

See [Chapter 7: Collisions](chapters/07-momentum-collisions/index.md) and [Glossary: Elastic Collisions](glossary.md#elastic-collisions), [Inelastic Collisions](glossary.md#inelastic-collisions).

### What is torque?

Torque is the rotational analog of force, causing objects to rotate about an axis. It equals the product of force and the perpendicular distance from the rotation axis (lever arm): τ = F·r·sin(θ). Measured in newton-meters (N·m), torque depends on both force magnitude and where it's applied—using a longer wrench increases torque for the same force. Opening a door is easier when you push far from the hinges (large lever arm) than near the hinges (small lever arm). Torque causes angular acceleration just as force causes linear acceleration, following τ = Iα where I is rotational inertia.

See [Chapter 8: Torque](chapters/08-rotational-motion/index.md) and [Glossary: Torque](glossary.md#torque).

### What is simple harmonic motion?

Simple harmonic motion (SHM) is oscillatory motion where the restoring force is directly proportional to displacement from equilibrium, following Hooke's Law (F = -kx). A mass on a spring exhibits SHM—when displaced and released, it oscillates sinusoidally with constant period and frequency. The motion is "simple" because the acceleration is always proportional to displacement but opposite in direction. Pendulums (for small angles), vibrating guitar strings, and atoms in molecules all exhibit SHM. Key characteristics include amplitude (maximum displacement), period (time per cycle), frequency (cycles per time), and conservation of mechanical energy as the system oscillates between kinetic and potential energy.

See [Chapter 9: Simple Harmonic Motion](chapters/09-oscillations/index.md) and [Glossary: Simple Harmonic Motion](glossary.md#simple-harmonic-motion).

### What are waves and how do they travel?

Waves are disturbances that transfer energy through a medium (mechanical waves) or through space (electromagnetic waves) without transferring matter. Waves have characteristic properties: wavelength (distance between crests), frequency (cycles per second), amplitude (maximum displacement), and speed (wavelength times frequency). **Transverse waves** have oscillations perpendicular to wave direction (light, waves on strings), while **longitudinal waves** have oscillations parallel to wave direction (sound). Waves can interfere (combine), reflect (bounce), refract (bend), and diffract (spread) depending on the medium and obstacles encountered.

See [Chapter 10: Waves](chapters/10-waves-sound/index.md) and [Glossary: Mechanical Waves](glossary.md#mechanical-waves), [Wave Properties](glossary.md#wave-properties).

### What is sound?

Sound is a longitudinal mechanical wave that propagates through a medium (air, water, solids) as compressions and rarefactions. When you speak, your vocal cords vibrate, creating pressure variations that travel through air at approximately 343 m/s at room temperature. Sound cannot travel through vacuum because it requires a medium for propagation. We perceive frequency as pitch (high frequency = high pitch) and amplitude as loudness. Sound exhibits all wave behaviors: reflection (echoes), refraction (bending), diffraction (spreading around obstacles), and interference (beats when two frequencies are close).

See [Chapter 10: Sound](chapters/10-waves-sound/index.md) and [Glossary: Sound Waves](glossary.md#sound-waves).

### What is light and how does it behave?

Light is electromagnetic radiation in the visible portion of the spectrum (approximately 400-700 nm wavelength) that can be detected by the human eye. Light exhibits wave-particle duality—behaving as both a wave (showing interference and diffraction) and as particles called photons. Light travels at approximately 3.0 × 10⁸ m/s in vacuum, the fastest speed possible in the universe. Light behaves as a transverse wave with oscillating electric and magnetic fields perpendicular to its direction of travel. It undergoes reflection (mirrors), refraction (lenses), dispersion (prisms), interference (thin films), diffraction (slits), and polarization (sunglasses).

See [Chapter 11: Light](chapters/11-light-optics/index.md) and [Glossary: Light Waves](glossary.md#light-waves).

### What is electric charge?

Electric charge is a fundamental property of matter that causes it to experience electromagnetic force. Charge exists in two types: positive (protons carry positive charge) and negative (electrons carry negative charge). Like charges repel, opposite charges attract. Charge is quantized—it comes in discrete units equal to the electron charge (1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ coulombs). The Law of Conservation of Charge states that the total electric charge in an isolated system remains constant. Charge can be transferred between objects through friction (rubbing), contact (touching), or induction (bringing charged objects near).

See [Chapter 12: Electric Charge](chapters/12-electric-charge-fields/index.md) and [Glossary: Electric Charge](glossary.md#electric-charge).

### What is an electric field?

An electric field is a region around a charged object where other charged objects experience an electric force. The field is a vector quantity pointing in the direction a positive test charge would be pushed. Electric field strength equals force per unit charge (N/C) and is visualized using field lines—imaginary lines showing field direction and strength (closer lines = stronger field). Field lines radiate outward from positive charges and inward toward negative charges. Electric fields enable action-at-a-distance: charged objects don't need to touch to exert forces on each other.

See [Chapter 12: Electric Field](chapters/12-electric-charge-fields/index.md) and [Glossary: Electric Field](glossary.md#electric-field).

## Technical Detail Questions

### What is the difference between precision and accuracy?

Precision refers to the reproducibility of measurements—how close repeated measurements are to each other—while accuracy refers to how close measurements are to the true or accepted value. You can have precise but inaccurate measurements (consistently measuring 9.2 m when the true value is 10.0 m) or accurate but imprecise measurements (measurements scatter around the true value: 9.8 m, 10.3 m, 9.9 m, 10.1 m). Ideal measurements are both precise (consistent) and accurate (correct). A poorly calibrated scale might give precise but inaccurate readings that cluster around the wrong value.

See [Chapter 1: Precision vs Accuracy](chapters/01-scientific-foundations/index.md) and [Glossary: Precision vs Accuracy](glossary.md#precision-vs-accuracy).

### What are significant figures and why do they matter?

Significant figures are the digits in a measurement that carry meaningful information about its precision. They indicate the reliability of measured or calculated values. Rules: (1) all non-zero digits are significant, (2) zeros between non-zero digits are significant, (3) leading zeros are not significant, (4) trailing zeros after a decimal point are significant. Measuring 12.50 cm has four significant figures, indicating precision to the hundredths place. In calculations, your answer should have no more significant figures than the least precise measurement used. Significant figures prevent false precision—claiming accuracy you don't actually have.

See [Chapter 1: Significant Figures](chapters/01-scientific-foundations/index.md) and [Glossary: Significant Figures](glossary.md#significant-figures).

### What is dimensional analysis and how is it used?

Dimensional analysis is a mathematical technique using units of measurement to check equations and convert between different unit systems. It's based on the principle that valid equations must be dimensionally consistent—both sides must have the same units. To convert units, multiply by conversion factors equal to 1 (e.g., 1 m/100 cm, 60 s/1 min) arranged so unwanted units cancel. For example, converting 50 mi/h to m/s requires multiplying by (1609 m/1 mi) × (1 h/3600 s) = 22.4 m/s. Dimensional analysis catches calculation errors and ensures physical validity.

See [Chapter 1: Dimensional Analysis](chapters/01-scientific-foundations/index.md) and [Glossary: Dimensional Analysis](glossary.md#dimensional-analysis).

### What is the difference between speed and velocity?

Speed is a scalar quantity measuring the rate of distance covered (distance ÷ time), while velocity is a vector quantity describing the rate of change of position (displacement ÷ time), including direction. A car traveling 100 km in 2 hours has a speed of 50 km/h, but we need direction to specify velocity (50 km/h northward). Average speed equals total distance divided by total time; average velocity equals net displacement divided by total time. If you drive in a circle and return to your starting point, your average velocity is zero (no net displacement) even though your average speed is nonzero.

See [Glossary: Speed](glossary.md#speed) and [Velocity](glossary.md#velocity).

### What are kinematic equations and when can I use them?

Kinematic equations are four mathematical relationships connecting displacement, initial velocity, final velocity, acceleration, and time for uniformly accelerated motion (constant acceleration). The equations are: (1) v = v₀ + at, (2) x = x₀ + v₀t + ½at², (3) v² = v₀² + 2a(x - x₀), (4) x = x₀ + ½(v₀ + v)t. Use these equations only when acceleration is constant. They apply to free fall (constant a = g), projectile motion (constant vertical acceleration), and uniformly accelerated cars. They don't apply when acceleration changes, like a rocket with decreasing fuel mass or non-uniform circular motion.

See [Chapter 2: Kinematic Equations](chapters/02-motion-one-dimension/index.md) and [Glossary: Kinematic Equations](glossary.md#kinematic-equations).

### What is projectile motion?

Projectile motion is two-dimensional motion of an object under the sole influence of gravity, combining horizontal uniform motion (constant velocity, zero acceleration) with vertical uniformly accelerated motion (constant downward acceleration g = 9.8 m/s²). The path is parabolic. To analyze projectile motion, decompose the initial velocity into horizontal and vertical components using trigonometry, then apply kinematic equations separately to each direction. Time is the linking variable—horizontal and vertical motions share the same time interval. Examples include thrown balls, kicked soccer balls, and cannonballs.

See [Chapter 3: Projectile Motion](chapters/03-motion-two-dimensions/index.md) and [Glossary: Projectile Motion](glossary.md#projectile-motion).

### What is free fall?

Free fall is motion under the sole influence of gravity, where all objects accelerate downward at the same rate regardless of mass (assuming negligible air resistance). Near Earth's surface, this acceleration is approximately 9.8 m/s² downward. Galileo demonstrated that a feather and hammer dropped on the Moon (no air) fall at the same rate. On Earth, air resistance affects light objects more than heavy objects, causing apparent differences in fall rate. In free fall, only gravity acts—no normal force, no air resistance. Astronauts in orbit experience continuous free fall around Earth.

See [Chapter 2: Free Fall](chapters/02-motion-one-dimension/index.md) and [Glossary: Free Fall](glossary.md#free-fall).

### What is centripetal force?

Centripetal force is the net force directed toward the center of a circular path that causes an object to follow that curved trajectory rather than moving in a straight line. It's not a new type of force—it's the net result of real forces like tension, gravity, or friction acting toward the center. For circular motion at constant speed, centripetal force equals mv²/r, where m is mass, v is speed, and r is radius. When you swing a ball on a string, the string's tension provides centripetal force. For a car turning, friction between tires and road provides centripetal force.

See [Chapter 5: Centripetal Force](chapters/05-applications-newtons-laws/index.md) and [Glossary: Centripetal Force](glossary.md#centripetal-force).

### What is the Work-Energy Theorem?

The Work-Energy Theorem states that the net work done on an object equals its change in kinetic energy: W_net = ΔKE = ½mv² - ½mv₀². This powerful relationship connects force (through work) directly to motion (kinetic energy). When you apply brakes to a car, the negative work done by friction reduces the car's kinetic energy to zero. The theorem applies to both constant and variable forces and provides an alternative to Newton's Second Law for solving mechanics problems. It's particularly useful when forces vary with position rather than time.

See [Chapter 6: Work-Energy Theorem](chapters/06-work-energy-power/index.md) and [Glossary: Work-Energy Theorem](glossary.md#work-energy-theorem).

### What is conservation of mechanical energy?

Conservation of mechanical energy states that in the absence of non-conservative forces (like friction), the total mechanical energy (sum of kinetic and potential energy) remains constant. As a pendulum swings, it continuously exchanges energy between kinetic (maximum at bottom) and potential (maximum at top), but the total stays constant. This principle applies when only conservative forces (gravity, springs) do work. With non-conservative forces present, mechanical energy decreases (converting to heat, sound, deformation) but total energy including all forms remains conserved according to the broader Law of Conservation of Energy.

See [Chapter 6: Conservation of Energy](chapters/06-work-energy-power/index.md) and [Glossary: Conservation of Energy](glossary.md#conservation-of-energy).

### What is impulse and how does it relate to momentum?

Impulse is the product of force and the time interval over which it acts, equal to the change in momentum: J = FΔt = Δp. Measured in N·s or kg·m/s, impulse describes how forces change an object's motion over time. The Impulse-Momentum Theorem states that impulse equals momentum change. This explains why airbags save lives: they increase collision time, reducing the force of impulse on passengers (same momentum change, longer time, therefore smaller force). Catching a baseball with a glove demonstrates this—you pull your hand back to increase stopping time and reduce impact force.

See [Chapter 7: Impulse](chapters/07-momentum-collisions/index.md) and [Glossary: Impulse](glossary.md#impulse), [Impulse-Momentum Theorem](glossary.md#impulse-momentum-theorem).

### What is rotational inertia?

Rotational inertia (also called moment of inertia) is the resistance of a rotating object to changes in its rotational motion, depending on both mass and mass distribution relative to the rotation axis. Unlike linear inertia (just mass), rotational inertia increases when mass is farther from the axis: I = Σmr². A figure skater has less rotational inertia with arms pulled in (mass closer to axis) than with arms extended (mass farther from axis), explaining why pulling in arms increases spin rate (conservation of angular momentum). Rotational inertia is the rotational analog of mass in Newton's Second Law: τ = Iα.

See [Chapter 8: Rotational Inertia](chapters/08-rotational-motion/index.md) and [Glossary: Rotational Inertia](glossary.md#rotational-inertia).

### What is angular momentum and how is it conserved?

Angular momentum is the rotational analog of linear momentum, calculated as the product of rotational inertia and angular velocity: L = Iω. Like linear momentum, angular momentum is conserved in isolated systems (no external torques). A spinning ice skater pulling in their arms demonstrates conservation—as I decreases (mass closer to axis), ω increases (spins faster) to keep L = Iω constant. Earth's rotation produces enormous angular momentum that stays constant, explaining why Earth continues spinning. Conservation of angular momentum explains everything from figure skating spins to formation of galaxies.

See [Chapter 8: Angular Momentum](chapters/08-rotational-motion/index.md) and [Glossary: Angular Momentum](glossary.md#angular-momentum), [Conservation of Angular Momentum](glossary.md#conservation-of-angular-momentum).

### What is Hooke's Law?

Hooke's Law states that the restoring force in a spring is directly proportional to its displacement from equilibrium: F = -kx, where k is the spring constant (stiffness) measured in N/m, and x is displacement. The negative sign indicates the force opposes displacement (pushes back toward equilibrium). A stiffer spring has a larger k value. Stretching a spring 5 cm requires twice the force needed to stretch it 2.5 cm. Hooke's Law applies to elastic materials within their elastic limit—beyond this, permanent deformation occurs and Hooke's Law fails. Springs following Hooke's Law produce simple harmonic motion.

See [Chapter 9: Hooke's Law](chapters/09-oscillations/index.md) and [Glossary: Hooke's Law](glossary.md#hookes-law).

### What is resonance?

Resonance is the dramatic increase in amplitude when a system is driven at its natural frequency—the frequency at which it naturally oscillates. Every system has one or more natural frequencies determined by its physical properties (mass, stiffness, length). When external driving force matches the natural frequency, energy efficiently transfers to the system, building large oscillations. Examples include pushing a child on a swing at just the right timing, shattering wine glasses with sound at their resonant frequency, and the Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapse. Resonance can be useful (musical instruments) or destructive (structural failures).

See [Chapter 9: Resonance](chapters/09-oscillations/index.md) and [Glossary: Resonance](glossary.md#resonance).

### What is wave interference?

Wave interference is the combination of two or more waves occupying the same space, producing a resultant wave according to the Superposition Principle—the resultant displacement equals the sum of individual wave displacements. **Constructive interference** occurs when waves combine in phase (crests align), producing larger amplitude. **Destructive interference** occurs when waves combine out of phase (crest meets trough), reducing or canceling amplitude. When two stones are dropped in water, ripples create complex patterns of constructive and destructive interference. Noise-canceling headphones use destructive interference to reduce unwanted sounds.

See [Chapter 10: Wave Interference](chapters/10-waves-sound/index.md) and [Glossary: Wave Interference](glossary.md#wave-interference), [Constructive Interference](glossary.md#constructive-interference), [Destructive Interference](glossary.md#destructive-interference).

### What is the Doppler Effect?

The Doppler Effect is the change in observed frequency of a wave when there is relative motion between the source and observer. When a source moves toward you (or you move toward it), you observe higher frequency (shorter wavelength); when moving apart, you observe lower frequency (longer wavelength). A train whistle sounds higher pitched as it approaches and lower pitched as it recedes. The Doppler Effect applies to all waves—sound, light, water. Police radar guns use the Doppler Effect to measure vehicle speeds. Astronomers use it to determine if stars are moving toward or away from Earth (redshift/blueshift).

See [Chapter 10: Doppler Effect](chapters/10-waves-sound/index.md) and [Glossary: Doppler Effect](glossary.md#doppler-effect).

### What is refraction and why does it occur?

Refraction is the bending of waves as they pass from one medium to another due to a change in wave speed. Light slows down when entering denser media (air to glass) and speeds up when entering less dense media (water to air). Snell's Law quantifies refraction: n₁sin(θ₁) = n₂sin(θ₂), where n is the index of refraction (ratio of light speed in vacuum to light speed in medium). Refraction explains why a straw appears bent in water, why lenses focus light, and why objects underwater appear closer than they are. The amount of bending depends on the ratio of speeds in the two media.

See [Chapter 11: Refraction](chapters/11-light-optics/index.md) and [Glossary: Refraction](glossary.md#refraction), [Snell's Law](glossary.md#snells-law).

### What is total internal reflection?

Total internal reflection is the complete reflection of light at the boundary between a denser and less dense medium when the angle of incidence exceeds the critical angle. Beyond the critical angle, no light refracts into the second medium—all light reflects back. This occurs only when light travels from higher to lower refractive index (e.g., glass to air, water to air, but not air to glass). Fiber optic cables exploit total internal reflection to trap light inside, enabling high-speed data transmission over long distances. Diamonds sparkle brilliantly because their high refractive index causes extensive total internal reflection, trapping and reflecting light internally.

See [Chapter 11: Total Internal Reflection](chapters/11-light-optics/index.md) and [Glossary: Total Internal Reflection](glossary.md#total-internal-reflection).

### What is Coulomb's Law?

Coulomb's Law describes the electric force between two charged objects as directly proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them: F = k(q₁q₂)/r², where k = 8.99 × 10⁹ N·m²/C² is Coulomb's constant. Like charges repel (positive force), opposite charges attract (negative force). The force follows an inverse square law like gravity—doubling the distance reduces the force to one-fourth. Coulomb's Law applies to point charges or spherically symmetric charge distributions and is fundamental to understanding electric interactions.

See [Chapter 12: Coulomb's Law](chapters/12-electric-charge-fields/index.md) and [Glossary: Coulomb's Law](glossary.md#coulombs-law).

## Common Challenges

### Why do heavier and lighter objects fall at the same rate?

This counterintuitive result follows from Newton's Second Law and the universal nature of gravitational acceleration. While heavier objects experience more gravitational force (F = mg), they also have more inertia (resistance to acceleration). The greater force and greater inertia exactly cancel: a = F/m = mg/m = g. All objects near Earth's surface accelerate downward at g = 9.8 m/s² regardless of mass. Air resistance obscures this in everyday experience—light objects like feathers have high surface area relative to weight, causing significant air drag. In vacuum (as demonstrated on the Moon), a feather and hammer fall together.

See [Chapter 2: Free Fall](chapters/02-motion-one-dimension/index.md) and [Glossary: Free Fall](glossary.md#free-fall).

### How do I know which kinematic equation to use?

Choose based on which variables you know and which you're solving for. Each equation uses four of five kinematic variables (displacement, initial velocity, final velocity, acceleration, time): (1) v = v₀ + at (no displacement), (2) x = x₀ + v₀t + ½at² (no final velocity), (3) v² = v₀² + 2a(x - x₀) (no time), (4) x = x₀ + ½(v₀ + v)t (no acceleration). List known variables, identify what you're solving for, and select the equation containing those variables. Sometimes you'll need to use multiple equations sequentially. Always check that acceleration is constant before using kinematic equations.

See [Chapter 2: Kinematic Equations](chapters/02-motion-one-dimension/index.md) and [Glossary: Kinematic Equations](glossary.md#kinematic-equations).

### What's the difference between mass and weight?

Mass is the amount of matter in an object (measured in kilograms), an intrinsic property that doesn't change with location. Weight is the gravitational force acting on that mass (measured in newtons), calculated as W = mg where g is local gravitational acceleration. Your mass remains 70 kg whether on Earth, Moon, or in space. Your weight on Earth is 686 N (70 kg × 9.8 m/s²), on the Moon is 115 N (70 kg × 1.6 m/s²), and in deep space is nearly zero. Weight depends on location; mass doesn't. Bathroom scales actually measure weight but display mass.

See [Chapter 4: Mass vs Weight](chapters/04-forces-newtons-laws/index.md) and [Glossary: Mass vs Weight](glossary.md#mass-vs-weight).

### Why doesn't an object in equilibrium move?

An object in equilibrium experiences zero net force—all forces are balanced. Newton's First Law states that zero net force means zero acceleration, not necessarily zero velocity. **Static equilibrium** means the object remains at rest (zero velocity). **Dynamic equilibrium** means the object moves with constant velocity (zero acceleration but nonzero velocity). A book resting on a table is in static equilibrium (normal force balances weight). A parachutist falling at terminal velocity is in dynamic equilibrium (air resistance balances weight). In both cases, net force equals zero, so acceleration equals zero.

See [Chapter 4: Equilibrium](chapters/04-forces-newtons-laws/index.md) and [Glossary: Equilibrium](glossary.md#equilibrium), [Static Equilibrium](glossary.md#static-equilibrium), [Dynamic Equilibrium](glossary.md#dynamic-equilibrium).

### How can work be zero if I'm pushing hard?

Work requires displacement in the direction of force. If you push against a wall that doesn't move, you do zero work despite expending energy (which converts to heat in your muscles). Work equals force times displacement times cos(θ): W = F·d·cos(θ). Three scenarios produce zero work: (1) zero displacement (pushing an immovable wall), (2) force perpendicular to displacement (θ = 90°, like centripetal force in circular motion), or (3) force opposite to displacement (negative work, like friction slowing a sliding block). "Work" in physics has a precise technical meaning different from everyday usage of the word.

See [Chapter 6: Work](chapters/06-work-energy-power/index.md) and [Glossary: Work](glossary.md#work).

### Why is kinetic friction less than static friction?

When surfaces are at rest relative to each other, microscopic irregularities interlock more deeply, creating stronger bonds between surfaces. Once motion begins, surfaces ride over these irregularities rather than settling into them, reducing the friction force. The coefficient of kinetic friction (μₖ) is typically 20-40% smaller than the coefficient of static friction (μₛ) for the same material pair. This explains why it's harder to start pushing a heavy box than to keep it moving, and why anti-lock brakes work—preventing wheel lockup keeps you in kinetic rather than static friction regime, allowing steering control.

See [Chapter 5: Friction](chapters/05-applications-newtons-laws/index.md) and [Glossary: Static Friction](glossary.md#static-friction), [Kinetic Friction](glossary.md#kinetic-friction).

### How do I set up free body diagrams?

Free body diagrams isolate a single object and show all forces acting on it. Follow these steps: (1) Choose your object and draw it as a simple shape or dot, (2) Identify all forces acting ON the object (not forces BY the object), (3) Draw force vectors as arrows starting from the object's center, with length proportional to magnitude and direction showing force direction, (4) Label each force (weight, normal, tension, friction, etc.), (5) Choose coordinate axes aligned with motion or slopes. Don't include forces the object exerts on other things—only forces acting on your chosen object. Free body diagrams are essential for applying Newton's Second Law.

See [Chapter 4: Forces and Newton's Laws](chapters/04-forces-newtons-laws/index.md).

### Why does a satellite in orbit not fall to Earth?

A satellite in orbit IS falling toward Earth continuously—it's in free fall! The key is that it has sufficient tangential velocity that as it falls, Earth's curved surface falls away beneath it at the same rate. The satellite's path curves downward due to gravity at exactly the rate Earth's surface curves away, resulting in a circular (or elliptical) orbit. The satellite needs no fuel to maintain orbit—once in motion, it continues indefinitely in the absence of air resistance. If you could throw a baseball fast enough (about 7.9 km/s horizontally), it would orbit Earth. Lower orbital velocity means tighter curves and eventual atmospheric reentry.

See [Chapter 5: Centripetal Force](chapters/05-applications-newtons-laws/index.md) and [Glossary: Centripetal Force](glossary.md#centripetal-force).

### What happens to energy in inelastic collisions?

In inelastic collisions, kinetic energy decreases (converts to other forms) while momentum remains conserved. The "lost" kinetic energy doesn't disappear—it transforms into heat, sound, permanent deformation, and vibrational energy. Car crashes dramatically demonstrate this: crumpling metal, screeching sounds, and heat from friction all represent kinetic energy conversion. Perfectly inelastic collisions (objects stick together) lose maximum kinetic energy consistent with momentum conservation. Even though kinetic energy isn't conserved in inelastic collisions, total energy including all forms remains conserved according to the Law of Conservation of Energy.

See [Chapter 7: Collisions](chapters/07-momentum-collisions/index.md) and [Glossary: Inelastic Collisions](glossary.md#inelastic-collisions).

### Why does a spinning figure skater speed up when pulling arms in?

This demonstrates conservation of angular momentum: L = Iω must remain constant in the absence of external torques. When the skater pulls arms inward, rotational inertia I decreases (mass moves closer to rotation axis). To keep L = Iω constant, angular velocity ω must increase proportionally. If I drops to half its original value, ω doubles. The skater does work pulling arms in against centrifugal tendency, converting chemical energy to increased rotational kinetic energy (½Iω²). Despite increased kinetic energy, angular momentum stays constant. This same principle explains why planets orbit faster when closer to the sun.

See [Chapter 8: Conservation of Angular Momentum](chapters/08-rotational-motion/index.md) and [Glossary: Conservation of Angular Momentum](glossary.md#conservation-of-angular-momentum).

## Best Practices

### How should I approach physics problem-solving?

Use the GUPSP framework: **Given** (list known quantities with units), **Unknown** (identify what you're solving for), **Principle** (state relevant physics laws and equations), **Solve** (perform calculations step-by-step, showing work), **Ponder** (check reasonableness of answer: correct units? Sensible magnitude? Limiting cases?). Draw diagrams for all problems—free body diagrams for forces, motion diagrams for kinematics, energy bar charts for energy problems. Write equations symbolically before substituting numbers. Always include units and check dimensional consistency. If stuck, ask: What physics principles apply? What's the strategy? Can I solve simpler versions first?

See [Course Description: Problem-Solving Framework](course-description.md).

### When should I use energy methods versus force methods?

Use energy methods (work-energy theorem, conservation of energy) when: (1) you know positions and speeds but not detailed time information, (2) forces vary with position, (3) multiple forces act and you care about overall effect, or (4) the problem involves springs or gravitational potential energy. Use force methods (Newton's Second Law) when: (1) you need to find acceleration or forces at specific instants, (2) you need time-dependent information, (3) forces are constant or easily described as functions of time. Many problems can be solved either way—choose the approach that requires fewer steps.

See [Chapter 6: Work and Energy](chapters/06-work-energy-power/index.md).

### How do I know which forces to include in my free body diagram?

Include only forces that directly act ON the object you're analyzing, not forces BY the object on other things. Common forces: **Weight** (gravity, always downward with magnitude mg), **Normal force** (perpendicular contact force from surfaces), **Tension** (pulling force through ropes/strings/cables), **Friction** (parallel to surfaces, opposes relative motion), **Applied forces** (pushes/pulls you explicitly apply), **Spring forces** (following Hooke's Law), **Drag** (air/fluid resistance, opposite to velocity). Don't include internal forces, centripetal force (it's a net effect of other forces), or inertial "forces" (ma is not a force—it's the result of forces).

See [Chapter 4: Forces](chapters/04-forces-newtons-laws/index.md).

### What's the best way to work with vectors?

For vector problems, use the component method: (1) Draw a coordinate system aligned with the problem (often with x horizontal and y vertical, or x along slopes), (2) Decompose all vectors into components using trigonometry: Aₓ = A cos(θ), Aᵧ = A sin(θ), (3) Work with components separately—x-components don't affect y-components, (4) Add/subtract corresponding components, (5) If needed, reconstruct magnitude using Pythagorean theorem (A = √(Aₓ² + Aᵧ²)) and direction using inverse tangent (θ = tan⁻¹(Aᵧ/Aₓ)). For 3D problems, include z-components. Never add magnitudes of non-parallel vectors directly—always use components or graphical methods.

See [Chapter 1: Vectors and Vector Operations](chapters/01-scientific-foundations/index.md).

### How do I analyze projectile motion problems?

Separate horizontal and vertical motions—they're independent except for sharing the same time. **Horizontal:** constant velocity (vₓ = v₀ cos(θ₀)), zero acceleration, use x = x₀ + vₓt. **Vertical:** uniformly accelerated motion with a = -g = -9.8 m/s², use kinematic equations with initial vertical velocity vᵧ₀ = v₀ sin(θ₀). Time is the linking variable connecting horizontal and vertical motions. Solve for time using one direction, then use that time in the other direction. Draw a trajectory diagram showing key points: launch, peak (vᵧ = 0), landing. Maximum range at 45° launch angle (neglecting air resistance).

See [Chapter 3: Projectile Motion](chapters/03-motion-two-dimensions/index.md) and [Glossary: Projectile Motion](glossary.md#projectile-motion).

### What's the best way to prepare for laboratory work?

Before lab: (1) Read the procedure completely, (2) Identify the physics concepts being investigated, (3) Understand what measurements you'll make and why, (4) Predict qualitative results, (5) Review safety protocols. During lab: (1) Record data directly in your notebook—no loose papers, (2) Include units with every measurement, (3) Note unusual observations, (4) Repeat measurements for reliability, (5) Estimate uncertainties. After lab: (1) Graph data promptly while details are fresh, (2) Calculate uncertainties and propagate through calculations, (3) Compare results to predictions/theory, (4) Identify sources of error, (5) Discuss what you learned beyond "confirming" expected results.

See [Course Description: Laboratory Work](course-description.md).

### How should I use the MicroSims effectively?

MicroSims are most valuable when used actively, not passively. Before using a MicroSim: read the related textbook section to understand the concept. During exploration: (1) Start with default parameters to see normal behavior, (2) Vary ONE parameter at a time to isolate effects, (3) Make predictions before changing parameters ("What will happen if...?"), (4) Test extreme values to find boundaries, (5) Look for patterns and relationships between variables. After exploration: (1) Summarize what you learned in words, (2) Connect simulation behavior to equations, (3) Think about real-world examples, (4) Try related problems to reinforce understanding. MicroSims supplement, not replace, hands-on laboratory experience.

See [MicroSims Index](sims/index.md).

### What resources should I use when I'm stuck?

Try resources in this order: (1) Reread the relevant textbook section carefully, (2) Check the glossary for term definitions, (3) Review worked examples similar to your problem, (4) Use MicroSims to visualize the concept, (5) Consult the learning graph to ensure you understand prerequisites, (6) Form a study group to discuss with peers, (7) Visit office hours or tutoring sessions with specific questions prepared. When asking for help, show your work—explain what you've tried and where you're stuck. Avoid just looking up answers—struggling productively builds problem-solving skills. Use online resources (Khan Academy, PhET simulations, HyperPhysics) as supplements, not replacements, for the textbook.

### How should I study for physics exams?

Physics isn't memorization—it's understanding and application. Study strategies: (1) **Active practice:** Solve problems without looking at solutions, (2) **Concept review:** Explain concepts in your own words without referring to notes, (3) **Problem categorization:** Group problems by concept/technique rather than chapter, (4) **Mistake analysis:** Review incorrect homework/quiz problems to identify patterns in your errors, (5) **Formula derivation:** Derive key equations from fundamentals rather than memorizing, (6) **Limiting cases:** Check equations for extreme values (What happens when v→0? when m→∞?). Create summary sheets connecting concepts. Form study groups for discussion. Prioritize understanding over memorization.

## Advanced Topics

### How does conservation of energy relate to conservation of momentum?

Both are fundamental conservation laws but apply in different contexts. **Conservation of momentum** requires no net external force and is a vector law (conserved in each direction independently). **Conservation of energy** (total energy including all forms) always holds, but conservation of *mechanical* energy requires no non-conservative forces. These laws are independent—they provide different constraints on physical systems. In elastic collisions, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved, giving you two equations to solve for two unknowns. In inelastic collisions, momentum is conserved but kinetic energy isn't, reflecting energy transformation to other forms.

See [Chapter 6: Energy](chapters/06-work-energy-power/index.md) and [Chapter 7: Momentum](chapters/07-momentum-collisions/index.md).

### What is the relationship between torque and angular acceleration?

Torque causes angular acceleration just as force causes linear acceleration. Newton's Second Law for rotation is τ_net = Iα, where τ is net torque, I is rotational inertia, and α is angular acceleration. This is directly analogous to F_net = ma. Greater torque produces greater angular acceleration; greater rotational inertia produces less angular acceleration for given torque. Just as force is the time derivative of linear momentum (F = dp/dt), torque is the time derivative of angular momentum (τ = dL/dt). When net torque equals zero, angular momentum is conserved—the rotational equivalent of momentum conservation.

See [Chapter 8: Torque and Rotation](chapters/08-rotational-motion/index.md).

### How do standing waves form?

Standing waves form through interference of two identical waves traveling in opposite directions, typically from a wave reflecting back on itself. At specific frequencies (determined by boundary conditions and medium properties), the incident and reflected waves interfere constructively and destructively at fixed positions, creating a pattern that appears stationary. **Nodes** (points of zero amplitude) occur where waves destructively interfere continuously; **antinodes** (points of maximum amplitude) occur where waves constructively interfere continuously. Musical instruments produce standing waves: guitar strings vibrate in patterns with nodes at both fixed ends, determining possible frequencies (harmonics).

See [Chapter 10: Standing Waves](chapters/10-waves-sound/index.md) and [Glossary: Standing Waves](glossary.md#standing-waves).

### What causes dispersion of light through a prism?

Dispersion—the separation of white light into its component colors—occurs because the refractive index of materials depends on wavelength. In glass, blue light (shorter wavelength) travels slower and refracts more than red light (longer wavelength). When white light enters a prism at an angle, different wavelengths refract by different amounts, separating spatially into a spectrum. The same phenomenon creates rainbows: water droplets act as prisms, dispersing sunlight. Dispersion limits optical system performance in telescopes and cameras, requiring special corrective lenses. It also enables spectroscopy—analyzing light composition by separating wavelengths.

See [Chapter 11: Dispersion](chapters/11-light-optics/index.md) and [Glossary: Dispersion](glossary.md#dispersion).

### How do lenses form images?

Lenses refract light rays to converge (convex/converging lenses) or diverge (concave/diverging lenses). **Convex lenses** bring parallel rays to a focal point, creating real images (can be projected on screen) when objects are beyond focal length, or virtual images (magnified, like magnifying glass) when objects are closer than focal length. **Concave lenses** spread parallel rays as if coming from a focal point, always creating virtual images that are reduced. The lens equation (1/f = 1/dₒ + 1/dᵢ) relates focal length f, object distance dₒ, and image distance dᵢ. Ray diagrams graphically show image formation by tracing key rays through lenses.

See [Chapter 11: Lenses](chapters/11-light-optics/index.md) and [Glossary: Lenses](glossary.md#lenses), [Convex Lenses](glossary.md#convex-lenses), [Concave Lenses](glossary.md#concave-lenses).

### What is the relationship between electric potential and electric field?

Electric field and electric potential are intimately related: the electric field is the negative gradient (spatial rate of change) of electric potential. In one dimension: E = -dV/dx. Electric potential (measured in volts) represents potential energy per unit charge, while electric field (measured in V/m or N/C) represents force per unit charge. Field points in the direction of decreasing potential—from high potential to low potential. You can calculate potential from field: V = -∫E·dx. When moving a positive charge against the electric field, you increase its potential energy. Equipotential surfaces are always perpendicular to electric field lines.

See [Chapter 12: Electric Potential](chapters/12-electric-charge-fields/index.md) and [Glossary: Electric Potential](glossary.md#electric-potential), [Electric Field](glossary.md#electric-field).

### How can I extend my learning beyond this textbook?

Explore advanced topics through: (1) **Online resources:** MIT OpenCourseWare, Khan Academy, PhET Interactive Simulations, Walter Lewin's lectures, (2) **Books:** "The Feynman Lectures on Physics" for intuitive explanations, "University Physics" for depth, "Six Easy Pieces" for conceptual understanding, (3) **Laboratory:** Design your own experiments investigating questions that interest you, (4) **Competitions:** Physics Olympiad, Science Olympiad, Science Fair, (5) **Research:** Email local university professors about research opportunities, (6) **Technology:** Build Arduino/Raspberry Pi physics projects, program simulations. Focus on deep understanding over broad coverage—mastering fundamentals enables self-directed advanced study.

### What physics concepts connect to engineering and technology?

Nearly all engineering relies on physics principles: **Mechanical engineering** applies mechanics (forces, energy, materials); **Electrical engineering** builds on electricity and magnetism; **Civil engineering** uses statics and dynamics for structures; **Aerospace engineering** applies fluid dynamics and thermodynamics; **Computer engineering** depends on solid-state physics and electromagnetism; **Biomedical engineering** combines mechanics with electromagnetic imaging; **Chemical engineering** uses thermodynamics and transport phenomena. Understanding physics fundamentals is essential for engineering innovation. Many technologies you use daily—smartphones, GPS, MRI scanners, solar panels, LED lights—are direct applications of physics concepts you're learning.

### How do physicists handle problems where multiple principles apply?

Complex problems often require combining multiple physics principles strategically. **General approach:** (1) Identify relevant principles (conservation laws, Newton's Laws, energy methods, etc.), (2) Choose the most efficient approach based on what's known and unknown, (3) Apply principles systematically, using each to extract different information, (4) Use one result to inform the next step. **Example:** A pendulum problem might use conservation of energy to find speed at bottom, then Newton's Second Law to find tension in string at that point. **Strategy:** Conservation laws provide global constraints (useful when you don't know details). Force laws give local/instantaneous information. Symmetry often simplifies problems dramatically.
