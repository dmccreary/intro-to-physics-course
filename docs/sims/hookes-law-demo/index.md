## About This MicroSim

This interactive simulation demonstrates Hooke's Law (F = kx) with a vertical spring-mass system. Drag the mass, add data points to the graph, and discover the linear relationship between force and displacement.

## How to Use

1. **Drag the mass** to stretch the spring to different positions
2. **Click "Add Data Point"** to record the current force and displacement
3. **Collect several data points** at different displacements
4. **Enable "Show best-fit line"** to see the linear relationship
5. **Compare the calculated slope** to the actual spring constant

## Key Concepts

- **F = kx**: Force is proportional to displacement
- **k = spring constant**: Measures spring stiffness (N/m)
- **The slope of F vs. x** equals k

## Controls

- **Spring k slider**: Change the spring constant
- **Mass slider**: Change the hanging mass
- **Release**: Start oscillation from current position
- **Add Data Point**: Record current measurement

## Lesson Plan

### Experiment: Measuring Spring Constant

1. Set a spring constant value
2. Add 5-6 data points at different displacements
3. Compare the best-fit slope to the actual k value
4. How close is your measurement?
