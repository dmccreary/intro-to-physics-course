## About This MicroSim

This simulation demonstrates how static friction responds to an applied force up to its maximum value, then transitions to kinetic friction when the object starts sliding.

## Key Concepts

- **Static friction adjusts** to match the applied force (up to a maximum)
- **Maximum static friction**: f_s^max = μ_s × N
- **Kinetic friction is constant**: f_k = μ_k × N
- **Kinetic friction < static friction** (typically μ_k ≈ 0.7 × μ_s)
