## About This MicroSim

This interactive tool helps students solve rotational kinematics problems by visualizing the motion and showing real-time graphs. Enter known quantities and the tool calculates the unknowns using the four kinematic equations.

## How to Use

1. **Enter known values** in the input fields (ω₀, α, t, θ₀)
2. **Click Solve** to calculate ω and θ
3. **Click Animate** to see the rotation
4. **Use presets** for common problem types

## Key Features

- **Animated rotating disk** shows the actual motion
- **Real-time graphs** display ω vs. t (linear) and θ vs. t (parabolic)
- **Equations panel** shows all four kinematic equations
- **Solution panel** displays all calculated values

## Lesson Plan

### The Four Rotational Kinematic Equations

1. ω = ω₀ + αt
2. θ = θ₀ + ω₀t + ½αt²
3. ω² = ω₀² + 2α(θ - θ₀)
4. θ = θ₀ + ½(ω₀ + ω)t

### Practice Problems

Try these scenarios using the simulator:

1. **A wheel starts from rest and accelerates at 2 rad/s² for 5 seconds. Find the final angular velocity and total rotation.**
2. **A spinning top at 30 rad/s decelerates at -3 rad/s². How long until it stops? How many radians does it rotate?**
