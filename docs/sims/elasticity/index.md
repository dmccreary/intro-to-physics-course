## About This MicroSim

This simulation demonstrates the concept of **elasticity** in collisions. When objects collide, some kinetic energy may be lost to heat, sound, or deformation. The elasticity coefficient (also called the coefficient of restitution) determines how much energy is retained after each bounce.

- **Elasticity = 1.0**: Perfectly elastic collision - no energy lost, ball bounces forever
- **Elasticity = 0.5**: Moderately inelastic - ball loses half its speed each bounce
- **Elasticity = 0.0**: Perfectly inelastic - ball stops immediately on impact

## How to Use

1. Click the **Run** button to start the simulation
2. Adjust the **Elasticity** slider to see how different values affect the bounce
3. Click **Pause** to stop the ball and observe its position
4. The ball will restart with a random velocity when you resume from rest

## Iframe Embed Code

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objectives

After using this simulation, students will be able to:

1. **Define** elasticity and the coefficient of restitution
2. **Explain** how energy is conserved or lost during collisions
3. **Predict** the behavior of bouncing objects based on their elasticity
4. **Compare** elastic and inelastic collisions

### Suggested Activities

1. **Exploration**: Set elasticity to 1.0 and observe. Then gradually decrease to 0. What patterns do you notice?

2. **Real-world connections**: What real objects have high elasticity (rubber balls, trampolines)? What has low elasticity (clay, sandbags)?

3. **Energy analysis**: Discuss where the "lost" energy goes in inelastic collisions (heat, sound, deformation).

### Key Concepts

- **Elastic collision**: A collision where kinetic energy is conserved
- **Inelastic collision**: A collision where some kinetic energy is converted to other forms
- **Coefficient of restitution**: The ratio of final to initial relative velocity between two objects after collision

### Connections to Physics Standards

This simulation supports understanding of:

- Conservation of energy
- Types of collisions
- Kinetic energy transformations
- Real-world applications of physics principles
