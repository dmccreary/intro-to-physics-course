## About This MicroSim

This interactive simulation demonstrates how mass and velocity combine to determine momentum, and shows momentum as a vector quantity that can be positive or negative depending on direction.

## Key Equation

$$\vec{p} = m\vec{v}$$

Where:
- **p** = momentum (kg·m/s)
- **m** = mass (kg)
- **v** = velocity (m/s)

## Visual Elements

- **Object Size**: Proportional to mass (larger = more massive)
- **Green Arrows**: Velocity vectors (pointing in direction of motion)
- **Colored Arrows Below Objects**: Momentum vectors (length proportional to momentum)
- **Vector Addition Diagram**: Shows how individual momenta add to give total system momentum

## Controls

- **Object A Mass**: Adjust mass from 0.1 to 10 kg
- **Object A Velocity**: Adjust velocity from -10 to +10 m/s
- **Object B Mass**: Adjust mass from 0.1 to 10 kg
- **Object B Velocity**: Adjust velocity from -10 to +10 m/s
- **Reset Defaults**: Return to initial values

## Key Observations

- Positive velocity → Positive momentum (moving right)
- Negative velocity → Negative momentum (moving left)
- A light fast object can have the same momentum as a heavy slow object
- Total momentum is the vector sum: pA + pB = pTotal
- When momenta are opposite, they partially or fully cancel

## Learning Objectives

- Understand that momentum is a vector quantity
- Calculate momentum from mass and velocity
- Perform vector addition of momenta
- Recognize that direction matters in momentum calculations
