## About This MicroSim

This simulation demonstrates **Newton's First Law (the Law of Inertia)** and how mass affects an object's resistance to changes in motion. Three objects with different masses (1 kg, 5 kg, and 10 kg) are subjected to the same force, allowing students to observe how:

- Lighter objects accelerate more than heavier objects
- All objects continue at constant velocity after the force stops
- The relationship F = ma determines the acceleration

## Learning Objectives

- Understand that inertia is the tendency of objects to resist changes in motion
- Apply Newton's Second Law (F = ma) to predict acceleration
- Recognize that mass is a measure of inertia
- Observe Newton's First Law in action (constant velocity when net force is zero)

## How to Use

1. Adjust the **Force** slider to set the applied force (5-50 N)
2. Adjust the **Time** slider to set how long the force is applied
3. Click **Apply Force** to push all three objects with equal force
4. Observe how different masses result in different accelerations
5. Watch the objects continue at constant velocity after the force stops
6. Click **Reset** to start over

## Key Concepts

- **Inertia**: The property of matter that resists changes in motion
- **Mass**: A measure of an object's inertia
- **Newton's First Law**: Objects in motion stay in motion at constant velocity unless acted upon by a net force
- **Newton's Second Law**: F = ma (acceleration is proportional to force and inversely proportional to mass)
