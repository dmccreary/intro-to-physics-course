## About This MicroSim

This interactive diagram demonstrates how torque depends on three factors:
- **Force magnitude (F)** - Larger forces create more torque
- **Distance from pivot (r)** - Forces applied farther from the pivot create more torque
- **Angle (θ)** - Forces perpendicular to the lever arm create maximum torque

## Key Observations

1. **Maximum torque** occurs when θ = 90° (force perpendicular to lever)
2. **Zero torque** occurs when θ = 0° or 180° (force along the lever)
3. **Perpendicular distance** (r⊥ = r sin θ) determines effective lever arm
4. **Net torque** is the sum of all individual torques

## Controls

- **Force slider**: Adjust the magnitude of the selected force
- **Angle slider**: Change the angle between force and lever
- **Position slider**: Move the force along the lever
- **F1-F4 buttons**: Select which force to adjust
- **Show perpendicular lines**: Toggle visualization of effective lever arms

## Lesson Plan

### Discussion Questions
1. Why do we push doors near the edge rather than near the hinges?
2. When is torque zero even though a force is applied?
3. How does the formula τ = rF sin θ explain these observations?
