## About This MicroSim

Use this interactive flowchart to classify whether an object is in equilibrium, and if so, what type. Click on the example buttons to see the decision path highlighted for different scenarios.

## Decision Process

1. **Is the net force zero?**
   - If NO → Object accelerates (NOT in equilibrium)
   - If YES → Continue to step 2

2. **Is the velocity zero?**
   - If YES → **Static Equilibrium** (at rest, stays at rest)
   - If NO → **Dynamic Equilibrium** (constant velocity)

## Key Insight

Being "at rest" does NOT mean equilibrium! A ball at the peak of its throw has v = 0, but it's NOT in equilibrium because gravity still accelerates it downward.
