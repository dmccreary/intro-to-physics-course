## Description

This MicroSim demonstrates free fall motion - objects falling under the influence of gravity alone. Adjust the initial height and initial velocity to explore different scenarios including objects dropped from rest, thrown upward, or thrown downward.

## Key Concepts

- **g = 9.8 m/s²** - Acceleration due to gravity (constant, downward)
- **All objects fall at the same rate** regardless of mass (in absence of air resistance)
- Objects thrown upward slow down, stop momentarily, then fall back down
- The velocity at any height during fall equals the velocity at that height during rise (but opposite direction)

## Free Fall Equations

- **y = y₀ + v₀t - ½gt²** - Position as function of time
- **v = v₀ - gt** - Velocity as function of time
- **v² = v₀² - 2g(y - y₀)** - Velocity-position relationship

## Learning Objectives

After using this MicroSim, students should be able to:

1. Apply kinematic equations to free fall problems
2. Understand that acceleration is constant (g) regardless of velocity direction
3. Predict the motion of objects thrown upward vs dropped
4. Calculate time of flight, maximum height, and impact velocity
