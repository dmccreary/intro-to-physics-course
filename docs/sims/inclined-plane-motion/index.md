## About This MicroSim

This simulation demonstrates the physics of objects on inclined planes, including the critical angle at which sliding begins and how friction affects acceleration.

## Key Concepts

- **Critical angle**: θc = arctan(μk) - angle at which block begins to slide
- **Weight parallel**: W∥ = mg sin θ (pulls block down slope)
- **Normal force**: N = mg cos θ (perpendicular to surface)
- **Friction**: f = μkN = μk mg cos θ (opposes motion)
- **Acceleration**: a = g(sin θ - μk cos θ) when sliding
