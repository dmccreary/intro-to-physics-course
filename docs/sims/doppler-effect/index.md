## About This MicroSim

This simulation demonstrates the **Doppler effect** - the change in observed frequency when a wave source is moving relative to an observer. As the source moves, wavefronts compress ahead (higher frequency) and spread out behind (lower frequency).

### Key Concepts

- **Wavefront compression**: Shorter wavelength ahead of moving source
- **Wavefront expansion**: Longer wavelength behind moving source
- **Frequency shift**: f' = f × v/(v ± vs)
- **Mach number**: Ratio of source speed to wave speed

### Controls

| Control | Range | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Speed | 0-80% of sound | Source velocity |
| Source freq | 200-1000 Hz | Frequency emitted by source |
| Direction | Left/Right | Source travel direction |
