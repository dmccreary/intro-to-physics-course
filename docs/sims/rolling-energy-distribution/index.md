## About This Chart

This visualization shows how total kinetic energy is distributed between translational (linear) and rotational motion for different rolling objects. Click anywhere on the chart to replay the animation.

## Key Observations

- **Sliding block**: 100% translational KE (no rotation)
- **Solid sphere**: 71.4% translational, 28.6% rotational
- **Hollow cylinder**: 50% each - energy split equally!

## The Physics

For a rolling object:
- **Total KE = ½mv² + ½Iω²**
- With v = rω (rolling constraint)
- The ratio I/mR² determines the split

Objects with higher I/mR² ratios store more energy in rotation, leaving less for translation - explaining why they roll more slowly!

## Lesson Plan

### Discussion Questions
1. Why does a sliding block have no rotational KE?
2. What determines how energy is distributed?
3. Why do hollow objects have a 50-50 split?
