## Description

This interactive MicroSim demonstrates the key differences between **speed** and **velocity** through six animated scenarios. Students can click on different scenarios to see how objects can have the same speed but different velocities, or how velocity can change while speed remains constant.

## Key Concepts

- **Speed** is a scalar quantity: it only tells you how fast something is moving, not which direction
- **Velocity** is a vector quantity: it includes both speed AND direction
- Speed is always positive or zero; velocity can be positive, negative, or zero depending on direction

## Scenarios Explained

1. **Straight Forward**: Object moves right at constant speed. Speed and velocity magnitude are equal.
2. **Straight Backward**: Object moves left at same speed. Speed is positive, but velocity is negative.
3. **Circular Motion**: Object moves at constant speed around a circle. Velocity continuously changes direction.
4. **Stationary**: No motion. Both speed and velocity are zero.
5. **Round Trip**: Object goes out and returns. Average speed is positive, average velocity is zero.
6. **Accelerating**: Object speeds up. Both speed and velocity increase together.

## Learning Objectives

After using this MicroSim, students should be able to:

1. Define speed and velocity and explain the difference
2. Identify whether a quantity is a scalar or vector
3. Recognize that velocity includes direction information
4. Explain why circular motion at constant speed involves changing velocity
