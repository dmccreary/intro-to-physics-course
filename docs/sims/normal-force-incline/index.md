## About This MicroSim

This simulation shows how the normal force on an inclined plane relates to the incline angle. As the angle increases, the normal force decreases according to N = mg cos(θ).

## Key Concepts

- **Normal force (N)**: Perpendicular to surface, N = mg cos(θ)
- **Parallel component (W∥)**: Along the slope, W∥ = mg sin(θ)
- At θ = 0° (flat): N = mg (full weight supported)
- At θ = 90° (vertical): N = 0 (no surface contact)

## Why This Matters

The normal force is crucial because:
1. It determines friction (f = μN)
2. It varies with angle, explaining why steeper slopes are harder to climb
3. Objects on steep slopes have less friction and slide more easily
