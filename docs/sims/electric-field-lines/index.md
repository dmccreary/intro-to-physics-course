## About This Simulation

Electric field lines are visual representations of the electric field around charged objects. They show:
- **Direction**: The direction a positive test charge would move
- **Strength**: Closer lines indicate stronger field regions
- **Source/Sink**: Lines originate from positive charges and terminate on negative charges

## How to Use

1. **Adjust Charges**: Use the q₁ and q₂ sliders to change charge magnitudes (-10 to +10 μC)
2. **Drag Charges**: Click and drag charges to reposition them
3. **Field Lines**: Adjust the number of field lines for more or less detail
4. **Show Vectors**: Enable "Show field vectors" to see field direction and relative strength at grid points

## Field Line Patterns

### Electric Dipole (Default)
- Lines exit the positive charge and enter the negative charge
- Field is strongest between the charges
- Creates the classic dipole pattern

### Like Charges (Both Positive or Both Negative)
- Lines repel each other
- No lines connect the two charges
- Field is zero at a point between them

### Single Charge
- Set one charge to zero to see radial field pattern
- Lines extend radially outward (positive) or inward (negative)

## Learning Objectives

After using this simulation, students should be able to:
- Sketch electric field lines for various charge configurations
- Predict field direction and relative strength from field line density
- Understand that field lines never cross
- Explain the difference between dipole and like-charge field patterns
