## About This MicroSim

This simulation allows you to investigate the relationship between pendulum length and period. Measure the period at different lengths and compare to the theoretical prediction.

## The Physics

For small angles, the period of a simple pendulum is:

**T = 2π√(L/g)**

Key observations:
- Period depends on **length** (longer = slower)
- Period is **independent of mass**
- Period is **independent of amplitude** (for small angles)

## How to Use

1. Set a pendulum length with the slider
2. Click "Release" to start swinging
3. Click "Measure Period" to time 10 complete swings
4. Click "Add to Graph" to record the data point
5. Repeat at different lengths
6. Compare your data to the theoretical curve

## Experiment Ideas

1. **Verify the formula**: Collect data at 5+ lengths and compare to theory
2. **Test mass independence**: Try different masses at the same length
3. **Large angle deviation**: Try 30° and see if the period differs from theory

## Lesson Plan

### Discussion Questions
1. Why doesn't mass affect the period?
2. What happens to the period if you double the length?
3. Why does the formula only work for small angles?
