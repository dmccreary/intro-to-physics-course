## About This MicroSim

This simulation visualizes the key vectors in uniform circular motion: velocity (tangent to the path), centripetal acceleration (toward center), and centripetal force (toward center).

## Key Equations

- **Centripetal acceleration**: $a_c = \frac{v^2}{r} = \omega^2 r$
- **Centripetal force**: $F_c = ma_c = \frac{mv^2}{r}$
- **Angular velocity**: $\omega = \frac{v}{r}$

## Key Insights

- Velocity is always tangent to the circular path
- Acceleration and force always point toward the center
- Velocity and acceleration are perpendicular
- Even at constant speed, direction change means acceleration
- "Centripetal" means "center-seeking"

## Controls

- **Speed**: Linear speed of the object
- **Radius**: Radius of the circular path
- **Mass**: Mass of the object
- **Show path positions**: Display ghost positions showing how velocity direction changes around the circle
