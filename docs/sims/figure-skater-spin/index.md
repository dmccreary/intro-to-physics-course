## About This MicroSim

This simulation demonstrates the conservation of angular momentum. When a spinning figure skater pulls their arms in, they spin faster - and this isn't magic, it's physics!

## The Physics

**Angular momentum is conserved:** L = Iω = constant

When arms are pulled in:
- **I decreases** (mass moves closer to rotation axis)
- **ω must increase** to keep L constant
- The skater spins faster!

When arms extend:
- **I increases** (mass moves farther from axis)
- **ω must decrease** to keep L constant
- The skater slows down!

## Controls

- **Arm Extension Slider**: Move arms in (0%) or out (100%)
- **Initial ω Slider**: Set the starting angular velocity
- **Show kinetic energy**: See how KE changes (it's not conserved!)
- **Reset**: Return to initial state

## Key Insight

Notice that while **angular momentum stays constant**, **kinetic energy changes**! When the skater pulls their arms in, they do work against centripetal force, adding energy to the system.

## Lesson Plan

### Discussion Questions
1. Where does the extra kinetic energy come from when arms are pulled in?
2. Why doesn't conservation of energy apply here?
3. Calculate: If I drops from 5 to 2 kg·m², by what factor does ω increase?
