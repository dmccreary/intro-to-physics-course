## About This Simulation

Coulomb's Law states that the electric force between two point charges is:
- Directly proportional to the product of their charge magnitudes
- Inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them

**Formula:** F = k|q₁q₂|/r²

Where:
- F is the electric force (Newtons)
- k = 8.99 × 10⁹ N·m²/C² (Coulomb's constant)
- q₁ and q₂ are the charges (Coulombs)
- r is the distance between charges (meters)

## How to Use

1. **Adjust Charges**: Use the q₁ and q₂ sliders to set charge values from -10 to +10 μC (microcoulombs)
2. **Set Distance**: Use the distance slider to adjust separation from 0.2 to 3.0 meters
3. **Observe Force**: Watch the force vectors and calculated force value change in real-time
4. **Toggle Graph**: Check "Show 1/r² graph" to visualize the inverse square relationship

## Key Observations

- **Opposite charges attract** (shown with green arrows pointing toward each other)
- **Like charges repel** (shown with red arrows pointing away from each other)
- **Force increases dramatically** as distance decreases (inverse square relationship)
- **Force is proportional** to the product of the charge magnitudes

## Learning Objectives

After using this simulation, students should be able to:
- Apply Coulomb's Law to calculate electric forces
- Predict whether charges will attract or repel
- Understand the inverse square relationship between force and distance
- Convert between microcoulombs and coulombs
