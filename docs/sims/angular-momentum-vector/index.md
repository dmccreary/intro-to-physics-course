## About This Diagram

This visualization illustrates that angular momentum (L) is a vector quantity. Its direction is determined by the right-hand rule and is parallel to the angular velocity vector (ω).

## The Right-Hand Rule

1. **Curl your fingers** in the direction of rotation
2. **Your thumb points** in the direction of L (and ω)

## Key Observations

- **Counterclockwise rotation** (when viewed from above): L points UP
- **Clockwise rotation** (when viewed from above): L points DOWN
- **L and ω are always parallel** (same direction)

## Why Vectors?

Angular momentum is a vector because:
- It has **magnitude**: L = Iω
- It has **direction**: Along the rotation axis
- It follows **vector addition rules**

This vector nature is crucial for understanding:
- Gyroscopic effects
- Precession
- Conservation of angular momentum in 3D

## Lesson Plan

### Discussion Questions
1. Which way does L point for Earth's rotation?
2. If you reverse the rotation, what happens to L?
3. Why is angular momentum conserved as a vector, not just a number?
