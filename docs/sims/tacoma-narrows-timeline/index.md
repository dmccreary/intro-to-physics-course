## About This Timeline

This interactive timeline chronicles the dramatic events of November 7, 1940, when wind-induced resonance caused the catastrophic collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge - one of the most famous engineering failures in history.

## The Physics of the Collapse

### What Caused the Oscillations?
- **Vortex shedding**: Wind flowing past the bridge deck created alternating vortices
- **Periodic forcing**: These vortices applied periodic forces to the structure
- **Natural frequency match**: The forcing frequency matched the bridge's natural frequency

### Why Did It Get Worse?
1. Initial **vertical oscillations** had moderate damping
2. System shifted to **torsional (twisting) mode**
3. Torsional mode had **much less damping**
4. Amplitude grew until structural failure

## Key Facts

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Bridge opened | July 1, 1940 |
| Span length | 2,800 feet (853 m) |
| Wind speed at collapse | 35-40 mph |
| Maximum twist angle | 45° |
| Torsional amplitude | 28 feet |
| Time to collapse | ~4 hours |
| Casualties | None (1 dog) |

## Legacy

The Tacoma Narrows collapse revolutionized bridge engineering:

- Led to wind tunnel testing of bridge designs
- Introduced aerodynamic considerations in bridge design
- Improved understanding of structural resonance
- Modern bridges use damping and streamlined shapes

## Lesson Plan

### Discussion Questions
1. Why was the bridge nicknamed "Galloping Gertie" before it collapsed?
2. How could engineers have prevented this disaster?
3. What other structures might be vulnerable to wind-induced resonance?
