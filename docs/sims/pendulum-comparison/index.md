## About This Diagram

This side-by-side comparison illustrates the key differences between a simple pendulum (idealized point mass on a massless string) and a physical pendulum (real rigid body with distributed mass).

## Simple Pendulum

- **Model**: Point mass on a massless, inextensible string
- **Center of mass**: Located at the bob
- **Period formula**: T = 2π√(L/g)
- **Key parameter**: Length L from pivot to mass

## Physical Pendulum

- **Model**: Rigid body that can rotate about a fixed axis
- **Center of mass**: Located within the body (may not be at the end)
- **Period formula**: T = 2π√(I/mgd)
- **Key parameters**: Moment of inertia I, distance d from pivot to center of mass

## Key Differences

| Property | Simple Pendulum | Physical Pendulum |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Mass distribution | All at one point | Distributed throughout body |
| String/rod | Massless string | Rigid body with mass |
| Formula | T = 2π√(L/g) | T = 2π√(I/mgd) |
| Examples | Idealized model | Swinging door, meter stick |

## Lesson Plan

### Discussion Questions
1. Why doesn't mass appear in the simple pendulum formula?
2. Under what conditions does a physical pendulum become equivalent to a simple pendulum?
3. Would a uniform rod pivoted at its end have a longer or shorter period than a simple pendulum of the same length?
