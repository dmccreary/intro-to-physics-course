## About This MicroSim

This simulation shows a mass-spring system undergoing simple harmonic motion with synchronized real-time graphs of position, velocity, and acceleration.

## Key Relationships

- **Position**: x(t) = A cos(ωt)
- **Velocity**: v(t) = -Aω sin(ωt)
- **Acceleration**: a(t) = -Aω² cos(ωt) = -ω²x

## Phase Relationships

- Position and acceleration are **180° out of phase** (opposite signs)
- Velocity **leads position by 90°** (quarter cycle)
- When x is maximum, v = 0 and a is maximum negative
- When x = 0, v is maximum and a = 0

## Controls

- **Amplitude slider**: Change maximum displacement
- **Frequency slider**: Change oscillation speed
- **Show vectors**: Display velocity and acceleration arrows on mass
- **Pause/Reset**: Control the animation

## Lesson Plan

### Discussion Questions
1. Why is velocity zero at maximum displacement?
2. Why is acceleration maximum at maximum displacement?
3. What is the relationship between a and x?
