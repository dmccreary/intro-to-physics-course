## About This MicroSim

This simulation demonstrates the work-energy theorem by showing how forces do work to change an object's kinetic energy. Watch a cart move along a track while applied forces and friction do work, then verify that net work equals the change in kinetic energy.

## Key Concepts

The work-energy theorem states:

$$W_{net} = \Delta KE = KE_f - KE_i = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - \frac{1}{2}mv_i^2$$

Where:
- W_net = net work done on the object
- ΔKE = change in kinetic energy
- m = mass
- v_i, v_f = initial and final velocities

## Controls

- **Start/Pause**: Begin or pause the simulation
- **Reset**: Return to initial conditions
- **Show Friction**: Toggle friction force on/off
- **Mass**: Adjust cart mass (1-20 kg)
- **Initial Velocity**: Set starting speed (0-15 m/s)
- **Applied Force**: Set external force (-50 to +50 N)
- **Friction Coefficient (μ)**: Set friction level (0-0.5)

## Visual Elements

- **Green Arrow**: Velocity vector (length proportional to speed)
- **Red Arrow**: Applied force
- **Orange Arrow**: Friction force (opposes motion)
- **Energy Bars**: Compare initial KE, final KE, and work done
- **Speedometer**: Real-time velocity display

## Learning Objectives

- Verify that net work equals change in kinetic energy
- Understand how positive work increases KE and negative work decreases KE
- See how friction dissipates mechanical energy
- Compare the force-based and energy-based approaches to motion analysis
