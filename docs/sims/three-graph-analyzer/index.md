## Description

This MicroSim displays synchronized position-time, velocity-time, and acceleration-time graphs showing how they relate to each other. A vertical cursor moves through all three graphs simultaneously, showing the values at each instant.

## Key Relationships

- **Slope of x-t = velocity**: The steeper the position graph, the higher the velocity
- **Slope of v-t = acceleration**: The slope of velocity graph gives acceleration
- **Area under v-t = displacement**: Shaded area shows change in position
- **Area under a-t = velocity change**: Area under acceleration gives change in velocity

## Learning Objectives

After using this MicroSim, students should be able to:

1. Connect features between position, velocity, and acceleration graphs
2. Predict graph shapes from motion descriptions
3. Identify acceleration from the curvature of position graphs
4. Understand the calculus relationships (derivatives and integrals) between motion variables
