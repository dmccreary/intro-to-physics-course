## About This MicroSim

This interactive simulation demonstrates **longitudinal waves**, where particles oscillate parallel to the direction of wave propagation. Sound waves in air are the most common example of longitudinal waves. When you click "Start Continuous," a wave travels from left to right, causing particles to bunch together (compressions) and spread apart (rarefactions).

### Key Concepts Demonstrated

1. **Parallel Motion**: Particles move in the same direction as the wave travels
2. **Compressions and Rarefactions**: Regions of high and low particle density
3. **Density Graph**: Shows how particle concentration varies as a sine wave

### Visual Indicators

- **Blue regions**: Compressions (high density)
- **Red regions**: Rarefactions (low density)
- **Blue particles**: At rest
- **Green particles**: Moving left (against wave direction)
- **Pink particles**: Moving right (with wave direction)

### Controls

| Control | Range | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Amplitude | 1-10 pixels | Maximum displacement from equilibrium |
| Speed | 1-8 | Wave propagation speed |
| Wavelength | 80-200 pixels | Distance between compressions |
| Start Continuous | Button | Begin continuous wave |
| Stop | Button | Pause the wave |
| Reset | Button | Return to initial state |
| Show density graph | Checkbox | Display density variation |

## Learning Objectives

After using this simulation, students should be able to:

1. Describe how particles move in a longitudinal wave
2. Identify compressions and rarefactions
3. Explain that particle motion is parallel to wave propagation
4. Compare longitudinal waves to transverse waves

## Lesson Plan

### Comparison Activity (15 minutes)
Use this simulation alongside the Transverse Wave Animation to compare:
- Direction of particle motion relative to wave direction
- How energy is transferred in each type
- Real-world examples of each type
