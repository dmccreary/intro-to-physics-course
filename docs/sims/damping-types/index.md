## About This Chart

This visualization compares the three types of damped oscillator responses when released from an initial displacement.

## Three Damping Types

### Underdamped (ζ < 1) - Blue curve
- **Oscillates** with exponentially decreasing amplitude
- Multiple crossings of equilibrium before settling
- Most physical oscillators (pendulums, springs, guitar strings)

### Critically Damped (ζ = 1) - Green curve
- **Fastest return** to equilibrium without overshooting
- Crosses equilibrium exactly once
- Optimal for shock absorbers, door closers

### Overdamped (ζ > 1) - Orange curve
- **Slow return** to equilibrium
- Never overshoots or oscillates
- Very viscous systems, heavily dampened mechanisms

## Applications

| Application | Damping Type | Reason |
|-------------|--------------|--------|
| Car shock absorbers | Near critical | Smooth ride, fast response |
| Screen door closers | Near critical | Close smoothly without slamming |
| Guitar strings | Underdamped | Want sustained vibration |
| Measuring instruments | Critical | Fast, accurate readings |

## Lesson Plan

### Discussion Questions
1. Why would engineers want critical damping?
2. What causes the oscillations in underdamped systems?
3. How could you increase damping in a physical system?
