## About This MicroSim

This simulation demonstrates **wave interference** from two coherent sources. When waves from both sources overlap, they create an interference pattern with regions of constructive interference (bright/high amplitude) and destructive interference (dark/low amplitude).

### Key Concepts

- **Constructive Interference**: Waves in phase combine to larger amplitude
- **Destructive Interference**: Waves out of phase cancel each other
- **Nodal Lines**: Lines of permanent destructive interference
- **Antinodal Lines**: Lines of permanent constructive interference

### Controls

| Control | Range | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Frequency | 0.5-5 Hz | Wave oscillation rate |
| Separation | 50-300 px | Distance between sources |
| Phase | 0-360° | Phase difference between sources |
| Wavelength | 20-80 px | Distance between wave crests |
