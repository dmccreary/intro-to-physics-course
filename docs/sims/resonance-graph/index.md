## About This Graph

This interactive visualization shows the resonance curve - how the amplitude of a driven oscillator depends on the driving frequency. The dramatic peak at the resonance frequency (ωd = ω₀) demonstrates why small periodic forces can produce large oscillations.

## Understanding the Graph

### X-Axis: Frequency Ratio (ωd/ω₀)
- **ωd/ω₀ < 1**: Driving frequency below natural frequency
- **ωd/ω₀ = 1**: Resonance - driving matches natural frequency
- **ωd/ω₀ > 1**: Driving frequency above natural frequency

### Y-Axis: Amplitude Ratio (A/A₀)
- Normalized amplitude compared to static displacement
- Can reach very high values at resonance with low damping

## Effect of Damping

| Damping Level | Peak Height | Peak Width | Real Examples |
|---------------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| Low (ζ < 0.3) | Very tall | Narrow | Tuning forks, guitar strings |
| Medium (ζ ≈ 0.5) | Moderate | Medium | Building structures |
| Critical (ζ = 1) | Low | Very broad | Shock absorbers |
| High (ζ > 1) | Minimal | No distinct peak | Heavy oil dampers |

## Key Observations

1. **At resonance**: Maximum energy transfer from driver to oscillator
2. **Below resonance**: Motion follows driving force
3. **Above resonance**: Motion opposes driving force (180° out of phase)
4. **Damping controls the peak**: More damping = lower, broader peak

## Lesson Plan

### Discussion Questions
1. Why do engineers need to know the natural frequency of structures?
2. How does damping protect against destructive resonance?
3. What happens if you push a swing at double its natural frequency?
