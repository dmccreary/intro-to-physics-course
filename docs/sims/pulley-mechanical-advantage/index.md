## About This MicroSim

This visualization compares three different pulley configurations, demonstrating how the number of supporting rope segments determines mechanical advantage.

## Configurations Shown

1. **Single Fixed Pulley (MA = 1)**: Changes direction only, no force advantage
2. **Single Movable Pulley (MA = 2)**: Two rope segments support load, force halved
3. **Block and Tackle (MA = 4)**: Four rope segments, force quartered

## Key Equations

- **Mechanical Advantage**: MA = Number of supporting rope segments
- **Applied Force**: F = Load Weight / MA
- **Rope Distance**: d_rope = MA × d_load
- **Work Conservation**: F × d_rope = W × d_load

## Key Insight

Higher mechanical advantage reduces the force needed but requires pulling more rope. Work (energy) is always conserved!

## Controls

- **Load Weight**: Adjust the weight being lifted to see how applied force changes for each configuration
