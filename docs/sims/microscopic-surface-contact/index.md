## About This MicroSim

This simulation demonstrates the microscopic origin of friction. While surfaces appear smooth to the naked eye, at the microscopic level they consist of peaks and valleys that interlock when pressed together.

## Key Concepts

- **Apparent vs. Actual Contact Area**: The actual contact area (where surfaces touch at peaks) is much smaller than the apparent area
- **Friction Origin**: Friction forces arise from molecular interactions at contact points
- **Surface Roughness**: Rougher surfaces have more pronounced peaks and valleys, affecting friction behavior

## Controls

- **Roughness**: Adjusts the amplitude of surface irregularities
- **Zoom**: Changes the magnification level of the microscopic view
- **Applied Force**: Simulates attempting to move the upper surface
- **Show attempted motion**: Toggles visualization of force direction and friction resistance
