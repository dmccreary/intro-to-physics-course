## About This MicroSim

This simulation demonstrates **standing waves** - wave patterns that appear to vibrate in place rather than traveling. Standing waves form when two waves of the same frequency travel in opposite directions and interfere.

### Key Concepts

- **Nodes (N)**: Points that remain stationary (zero displacement)
- **Antinodes (A)**: Points with maximum oscillation amplitude
- **Harmonics**: The sequence of standing wave patterns (n = 1, 2, 3, ...)
- **Wavelength**: λn = 2L/n where L is string length
- **Frequency**: fn = n × f₁ (integer multiples of fundamental)

### Controls

| Control | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| n = 1 to 6 | Select harmonic number |
| Amplitude | Maximum displacement |
| Speed | Animation speed |
| Play/Pause | Control animation |

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to:

1. Identify nodes and antinodes in standing wave patterns
2. Explain the relationship between harmonic number and wavelength
3. Calculate the number of nodes and antinodes for any harmonic
4. Understand why only certain frequencies produce standing waves
