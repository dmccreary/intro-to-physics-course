## About This MicroSim

This simulation demonstrates the physics of a car navigating a curve. Friction between the tires and road provides the centripetal force needed to keep the car moving in a circle. If the required centripetal force exceeds the maximum static friction, the car skids.

## Key Equations

- **Centripetal acceleration**: ac = v²/r
- **Required centripetal force**: Fc = mv²/r
- **Maximum friction**: fs_max = μs × mg
- **Maximum safe speed**: v_max = √(μs × g × r)

## Key Insight

Mass cancels in the maximum speed equation, so all vehicles have the same maximum safe speed on a given curve!
