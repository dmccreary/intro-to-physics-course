## About This MicroSim

This simulation demonstrates **Snell's Law**, which describes how light bends when passing from one medium to another. The amount of bending depends on the indices of refraction of both media.

### Key Concepts

- **Index of Refraction (n)**: How much a medium slows down light
- **Snell's Law**: n₁ sin θ₁ = n₂ sin θ₂
- **Total Internal Reflection**: When light cannot refract out of a denser medium
- **Critical Angle**: The incident angle at which TIR begins

### Controls

| Control | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Angle slider | Adjust angle of incidence |
| Top medium | Select upper medium (Air, Water, Glass, Diamond) |
| Bottom medium | Select lower medium |
| Swap Media | Exchange the two media |

### Observations

- Light bends **toward** the normal when entering a denser medium
- Light bends **away** from the normal when entering a less dense medium
- Total internal reflection occurs only when going from denser to less dense medium at angles above the critical angle
