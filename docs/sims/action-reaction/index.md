## About This MicroSim

This simulation demonstrates **Newton's Third Law** through six interactive scenarios. Each scenario shows how forces always come in pairs - when object A exerts a force on object B, object B simultaneously exerts an equal and opposite force on object A.

## Scenarios

1. **Book on Table** - Two separate action-reaction pairs: gravity and contact forces
2. **Hammer and Nail** - Why the nail moves more despite equal forces
3. **Rocket in Space** - How propulsion works without anything to push against
4. **Swimming** - Why you push water backward to move forward
5. **Earth-Moon System** - Gravitational attraction is mutual
6. **Car Accelerating** - The road pushes the car, not the engine

## Key Concepts

- Action-reaction pairs are **always equal in magnitude**
- Action-reaction pairs **always act on different objects**
- Action-reaction pairs are **always the same type of force**
- Weight and normal force are NOT an action-reaction pair (both act on the same object)

## Common Misconception

"If action and reaction are equal and opposite, why don't they cancel out?"

**Answer**: They act on DIFFERENT objects! The force on object A affects A's motion, while the force on object B affects B's motion. Forces only cancel when they act on the SAME object.
