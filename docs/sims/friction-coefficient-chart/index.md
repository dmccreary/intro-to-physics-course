## About This Chart

This visualization compares static and kinetic friction coefficients for eight common material pairs. The horizontal bar chart makes it easy to see how different materials compare and why static friction is typically greater than kinetic friction.

## Key Observations

- **Static > Kinetic**: For all material pairs, static friction exceeds kinetic friction
- **Rubber on concrete**: Highest friction - essential for vehicle safety
- **Ice on ice**: Extremely low friction - enables skating and makes icy roads dangerous
- **Lubricants**: Greasy steel shows dramatically lower friction than dry steel

## Key Equations

- **Maximum static friction**: $f_s^{max} = \mu_s N$
- **Kinetic friction**: $f_k = \mu_k N$

Where N is the normal force perpendicular to the surfaces.
