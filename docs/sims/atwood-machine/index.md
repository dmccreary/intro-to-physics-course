## About This MicroSim

The Atwood machine demonstrates Newton's second law with connected masses. When the masses are unequal, the system accelerates with both masses moving at the same rate (one up, one down).

## Key Equations

- **Acceleration**: a = (m₂ - m₁)g / (m₁ + m₂)
- **Tension**: T = 2m₁m₂g / (m₁ + m₂)

## Key Insights

- If m₁ = m₂: System is in equilibrium (a = 0)
- Tension is always between m₁g and m₂g
- Both masses have the same magnitude of acceleration
