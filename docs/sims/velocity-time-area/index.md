## Description

This MicroSim demonstrates the fundamental relationship that the **area under a velocity-time curve equals displacement**. Students can select different motion scenarios and adjust the time interval to see how the shaded area corresponds to the change in position.

## Key Concepts

- **Positive area** (above the time axis) = positive displacement (motion in + direction)
- **Negative area** (below the time axis) = negative displacement (motion in - direction)
- **Net displacement** = positive area - negative area
- For **rectangles**: Area = velocity × time
- For **triangles**: Area = ½ × base × height

## Scenarios

1. **Constant Positive Velocity**: Rectangle - simple v × t
2. **Constant Negative Velocity**: Rectangle below axis - negative displacement
3. **Acceleration from Rest**: Triangle - ½ × t × v
4. **Deceleration to Stop**: Trapezoid - average velocity × time
5. **Speed Up Then Slow Down**: Two triangles forming a peak
6. **Direction Reversal**: Area both above and below axis

## Learning Objectives

After using this MicroSim, students should be able to:

1. Calculate displacement from the area under a v-t curve
2. Distinguish between positive and negative areas
3. Apply geometric formulas (rectangle, triangle, trapezoid) for area calculation
4. Understand that net displacement accounts for direction changes
