## About This MicroSim

This simulation shows velocity vectors at different points on a rolling wheel. Each point has velocity from both the wheel's translation (v_cm) and its rotation (ωr).

## Key Observations

- **Bottom point**: v = 0 (instantaneously stationary!)
- **Center point**: v = v_cm (pure translation)
- **Top point**: v = 2v_cm (translation + rotation add)
- **Side points**: Have components in both directions

## Rolling Without Slipping

The constraint v_cm = rω ensures the bottom point is stationary. This is what allows static friction to enable rolling without slipping.

## Controls

- **Speed Slider**: Adjust the center of mass velocity
- **Freeze Frame**: Pause to examine velocity vectors
- **Show vectors**: Toggle velocity vector display
- **Show trace paths**: See the cycloid path of rim points!

## Lesson Plan

### Discussion Questions
1. Why is the bottom point stationary?
2. What happens if v_cm ≠ rω?
3. What shape does the top point trace? (Hint: cycloid)
