## About This MicroSim

This interactive diagram demonstrates how the angle between an applied force and displacement affects the work done. Five common physics scenarios are shown:

1. **Pushing Cart** - Force and displacement in the same direction (θ = 0°, maximum positive work)
2. **Lifting Box** - Upward force with upward displacement (θ = 0°, positive work against gravity)
3. **Friction** - Force opposite to displacement (θ = 180°, maximum negative work)
4. **Carrying Box** - Force perpendicular to displacement (θ = 90°, zero work)
5. **Pulling Sled** - Force at an adjustable angle (interactive, W = Fd cos θ)

## Key Concepts

The work done by a constant force is:

$$W = F \cdot d \cdot \cos(\theta)$$

Where:
- W = work (joules)
- F = force magnitude (newtons)
- d = displacement magnitude (meters)
- θ = angle between force and displacement vectors

## Controls

- **Angle Slider**: Adjusts the rope angle in Panel 5 from 0° to 90° to see how work changes

## Learning Objectives

- Understand that only the component of force parallel to displacement does work
- Recognize that perpendicular forces do zero work
- Apply the work formula W = Fd cos(θ) to different scenarios
