## About This MicroSim

This simulation demonstrates the key technique for solving inclined plane problems: decomposing the weight vector into components parallel and perpendicular to the surface. This choice of coordinate system simplifies the analysis dramatically.

## Key Equations

- **Weight component parallel to incline**: $mg \sin\theta$ (causes sliding)
- **Weight component perpendicular to incline**: $mg \cos\theta$ (balanced by N)
- **Normal force**: $N = mg \cos\theta$
- **Maximum static friction**: $f_s^{max} = \mu_s N$
- **Critical angle**: $\theta_c = \arctan(\mu_s)$

## Key Insights

- Choose axes parallel and perpendicular to the incline surface
- Normal force exactly balances the perpendicular weight component
- The parallel component drives the block down the slope
- At the critical angle, friction can no longer prevent sliding

## Controls

- **Angle θ**: Inclination angle of the plane
- **Mass**: Mass of the block
- **μs**: Coefficient of static friction
- **Show decomposition**: Toggle the weight component vectors
- **Show tilted axes**: Display the rotated coordinate system
