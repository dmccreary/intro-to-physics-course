## About This Diagram

This interactive diagram compares the three types of collisions side by side, showing what happens before, during, and after each collision type. Click anywhere to cycle through the phases.

## Collision Types

| Type | Momentum Conserved? | KE Conserved? | Objects After |
|------|---------------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Elastic** | Yes | Yes | Separate, no deformation |
| **Inelastic** | Yes | No | Separate, some deformation |
| **Perfectly Inelastic** | Yes | No | Stick together |

## Example Scenario

All three columns show:
- **Ball 1**: 3 kg, initially moving at 4 m/s
- **Ball 2**: 1 kg, initially at rest
- **Initial momentum**: 12 kg·m/s
- **Initial KE**: 24 J

## Key Observations

1. **Momentum is ALWAYS conserved** in all three types (no external forces)
2. **Only elastic collisions conserve kinetic energy**
3. **Perfectly inelastic has maximum KE loss** (objects stick together)
4. **"Lost" energy becomes heat, sound, or deformation** - it's not destroyed

## Interaction

Click anywhere on the diagram to cycle through:
1. **Before**: Initial conditions before collision
2. **During**: Collision in progress
3. **After**: Final state after collision

## Learning Objectives

- Distinguish between elastic, inelastic, and perfectly inelastic collisions
- Understand that momentum is conserved in all isolated collisions
- Recognize that kinetic energy conservation distinguishes collision types
- Apply conservation principles to predict collision outcomes
