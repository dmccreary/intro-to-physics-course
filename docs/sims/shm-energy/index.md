## About This MicroSim

This animated visualization shows how energy continuously transforms between kinetic and potential forms during simple harmonic motion, while total mechanical energy remains constant.

## Energy in SHM

- **Kinetic Energy**: KE = ½mv²
- **Potential Energy**: PE = ½kx²
- **Total Energy**: E = ½kA² (constant!)

## Key Observations

- At **maximum displacement** (x = ±A): PE is maximum, KE = 0
- At **equilibrium** (x = 0): KE is maximum, PE = 0
- **Total energy stays constant** (horizontal dashed line)
- Energy "sloshes" back and forth between KE and PE

## Controls

- **Amplitude slider**: Change maximum displacement (affects total energy)
- **Spring k slider**: Change spring constant (affects total energy)
- **Pause/Start**: Control the animation

## Lesson Plan

### Discussion Questions
1. What happens to total energy if you double the amplitude?
2. Why is KE zero at maximum displacement?
3. How does the spring constant affect the energy?
