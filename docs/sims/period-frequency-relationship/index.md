## About This Diagram

This interactive infographic visualizes the mathematical relationships between the three key quantities describing oscillations: period (T), frequency (f), and angular frequency (ω).

## The Three Quantities

### Period (T)
- **Definition**: Time for one complete cycle
- **Units**: seconds (s)
- **Example**: A pendulum taking 2.0 s to swing back and forth has T = 2.0 s

### Frequency (f)
- **Definition**: Number of cycles per second
- **Units**: hertz (Hz) = 1/s = s⁻¹
- **Example**: 0.5 Hz means half a cycle per second

### Angular Frequency (ω)
- **Definition**: Radians per second of oscillation
- **Units**: rad/s
- **Example**: ω = π rad/s means the phase advances by π radians each second

## Key Relationships

| Conversion | Formula |
|------------|---------|
| Period ↔ Frequency | f = 1/T, T = 1/f |
| Period → Angular Frequency | ω = 2π/T |
| Frequency → Angular Frequency | ω = 2πf |

## Lesson Plan

### Discussion Questions
1. If you double the period, what happens to frequency?
2. Why is there a factor of 2π in the angular frequency formula?
3. A swing has period 3 seconds. What are f and ω?
