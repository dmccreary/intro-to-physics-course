## Description

This MicroSim provides a side-by-side comparison of **uniform motion** (constant velocity) and **uniformly accelerated motion** (constant acceleration) through synchronized graphs showing position, velocity, and acceleration over time.

## Key Observations

### Uniform Motion (Left Column)
- **Position-Time**: Linear (straight line) - position increases at constant rate
- **Velocity-Time**: Horizontal line - velocity stays constant
- **Acceleration-Time**: Zero - no change in velocity

### Uniformly Accelerated Motion (Right Column)
- **Position-Time**: Parabolic curve - position increases at increasing rate
- **Velocity-Time**: Straight sloped line - velocity increases linearly
- **Acceleration-Time**: Horizontal non-zero line - acceleration stays constant

## Learning Objectives

After using this MicroSim, students should be able to:

1. Identify the characteristic graph shapes for uniform and accelerated motion
2. Explain why the position-time graph is curved for accelerated motion
3. Understand that the slope of position-time gives velocity
4. Recognize that the slope of velocity-time gives acceleration
5. Connect the area under the velocity-time curve to displacement
