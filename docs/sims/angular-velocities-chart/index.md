## About This Chart

This visualization compares the angular velocities of common rotating objects, spanning over 10 orders of magnitude from Earth's rotation to dental drills. The logarithmic scale allows meaningful comparison of these vastly different rotation rates.

## Key Observations

- **Earth's rotation** is incredibly slow at just 7.27 × 10⁻⁵ rad/s
- **Human-scale rotations** (highlighted in green) range from about 1 to 1000 rad/s
- **Dental drills** spin at 50,000 rad/s - nearly a million rpm!
- **Each major tick mark** represents a factor of 10 increase

## How to Read the Chart

- Hover over any bar to see the exact angular velocity in rad/s and rpm
- The bars are color-coded from blue (slower) to red (faster)
- The green shaded region shows "human-scale" rotations we commonly encounter

## Lesson Plan

### Discussion Questions

1. Why is a logarithmic scale necessary for this comparison?
2. Convert Earth's angular velocity to revolutions per day - does it match what you know?
3. Why do hard drives spin faster than ceiling fans?
