## Description

This interactive tool helps students choose the correct kinematic equation by clicking on variables to mark them as "Known" or "Find This". The tool analyzes the selection and recommends the appropriate equation.

## How to Use

1. Click on variables to cycle through states: Unknown → Known → Find This
2. Mark at least 3 variables as "Known"
3. Mark exactly one variable as "Find This"
4. The recommended equation will be highlighted

## The Four Kinematic Equations

1. **v = v₀ + at** - Missing position (x)
2. **x = x₀ + v₀t + ½at²** - Missing final velocity (v)
3. **v² = v₀² + 2a(x-x₀)** - Missing time (t)
4. **x = x₀ + ½(v₀+v)t** - Missing acceleration (a)

## Learning Objectives

After using this tool, students should be able to:

1. Identify which kinematic equation to use based on known variables
2. Recognize that each equation is missing one variable
3. Systematically approach kinematics problems by listing knowns and unknowns
