## Description

This interactive MicroSim helps students learn to interpret position-time graphs. Select different motion scenarios and observe how the graph shape relates to the object's motion. The tangent line shows the instantaneous velocity at any point.

## Key Concepts

- **Slope = Velocity**: The slope of a position-time graph at any point equals the velocity
- **Steeper = Faster**: A steeper line means faster motion
- **Horizontal = Stationary**: A flat horizontal line means the object isn't moving
- **Curved = Accelerating**: A curved line indicates changing velocity (acceleration)

## Scenarios

1. **Constant Positive Velocity**: Straight line going up - steady motion forward
2. **Constant Negative Velocity**: Straight line going down - steady motion backward
3. **At Rest**: Horizontal line - no motion
4. **Positive Acceleration**: Curve getting steeper - speeding up
5. **Negative Acceleration**: Curve flattening then reversing - slowing down
6. **Complex Motion**: Multiple segments showing different motion types

## Learning Objectives

After using this MicroSim, students should be able to:

1. Determine velocity from the slope of a position-time graph
2. Identify when an object is at rest, moving forward, or moving backward
3. Recognize acceleration from the curvature of the graph
4. Connect graph features to physical motion of an object
