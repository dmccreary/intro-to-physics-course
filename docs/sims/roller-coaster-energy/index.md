## About This MicroSim

This simulation demonstrates conservation of mechanical energy by showing a cart rolling along a roller coaster track. Watch as energy transforms between kinetic energy (speed) and potential energy (height) while the total mechanical energy remains constant.

## Key Concepts

Conservation of mechanical energy:

$$KE_i + PE_i = KE_f + PE_f$$

$$\frac{1}{2}mv_i^2 + mgh_i = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 + mgh_f$$

At any point along the track:
- **Maximum PE, minimum KE**: At the highest points (cart moves slowest)
- **Maximum KE, minimum PE**: At the lowest points (cart moves fastest)
- **Total energy**: Remains constant (green line stays flat)

## Controls

- **Release Cart**: Start the simulation from the top of the track
- **Pause/Resume**: Pause or continue the simulation
- **Reset**: Return cart to starting position
- **Track Shape**: Choose between Simple Hill, Double Hill, or Loop-de-loop
- **Mass**: Adjust cart mass (0.5-5 kg)
- **Height**: Set initial drop height (5-15 m)
- **Friction**: Add friction to see energy dissipation (0-0.3)

## Visual Elements

- **Stacked Bar Chart**: Shows current KE (blue) and PE (red) distribution
- **Energy vs Time Graph**: Plots KE, PE, and total energy over time
- **Cart Color**: Changes from blue (slow) to red (fast) based on speed
- **Height Markers**: Reference scale on left side

## Learning Objectives

- Visualize energy transformation between kinetic and potential forms
- Verify that total mechanical energy remains constant without friction
- Understand how friction causes mechanical energy to decrease over time
- Predict where the cart will move fastest and slowest
