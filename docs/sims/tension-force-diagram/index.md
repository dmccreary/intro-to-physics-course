## About This MicroSim

This simulation illustrates how tension forces are transmitted through a rope connecting two objects. The key insight is that for a massless, inextensible rope, tension is uniform throughout its length.

## Key Concepts

- **Tension pulls equally on both ends**: The rope exerts the same force on both connected objects
- **Uniform tension**: For a massless rope, you can "cut" it anywhere and find the same tension value
- **Action-reaction pairs**: At any point in the rope, tension forces form an action-reaction pair
- **Massless rope assumption**: Simplifies analysis by making tension constant throughout

## Controls

- **Applied Force**: Changes the external force pulling on Block A
- **Friction**: Adjusts the friction force opposing Block B's motion
- **Show rope cuts**: Visualizes the action-reaction tension pairs at imaginary cut points
- **Animate forces**: Adds subtle animation to highlight force directions
