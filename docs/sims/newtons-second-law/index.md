## About This MicroSim

This simulation visualizes the fundamental relationship in classical mechanics: **F = ma**. Two interactive graphs show how acceleration depends on both force and mass:

- **Graph 1 (Acceleration vs Force)**: Shows linear relationships for different fixed masses
- **Graph 2 (Acceleration vs Mass)**: Shows inverse (hyperbolic) relationships for different fixed forces

## Key Concepts

1. **Force and Acceleration are Proportional**: Doubling the force doubles the acceleration (if mass is constant)
2. **Mass and Acceleration are Inversely Related**: Doubling the mass halves the acceleration (if force is constant)
3. **The Equation Links All Three**: a = F/m

## Learning Objectives

- Visualize how acceleration depends on force and mass
- Understand linear vs inverse relationships graphically
- Apply F = ma to predict motion outcomes
- Recognize that mass is a measure of "resistance to acceleration"

## How to Use

1. Use the **Force** slider to change the applied force (0-100 N)
2. Use the **Mass** slider to change the object's mass (1-20 kg)
3. Watch the purple point move on both graphs
4. Observe the calculated acceleration update in real-time
