## About This MicroSim

This simulation demonstrates the **law of reflection**, a fundamental principle in optics stating that when light reflects off a surface, the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection (θᵢ = θᵣ). Both angles are measured from the normal (perpendicular line) to the surface.

### Key Concepts

- **Incident Ray**: The incoming light ray
- **Reflected Ray**: The outgoing light ray
- **Normal**: Line perpendicular to the reflecting surface
- **Angle of Incidence (θᵢ)**: Angle between incident ray and normal
- **Angle of Reflection (θᵣ)**: Angle between reflected ray and normal

### Controls

| Control | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Angle slider | Adjust angle of incidence (0-85°) |
| Show normal line | Toggle normal line visibility |
| Show angle measurements | Toggle angle arc display |
| Reset to 45° | Return to default angle |
