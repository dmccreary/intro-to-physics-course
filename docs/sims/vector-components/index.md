## Description

This MicroSim demonstrates how any 2D velocity vector can be decomposed into horizontal (x) and vertical (y) components using trigonometry. Adjust the magnitude and angle to see how the components change.

## Key Formulas

- **vx = v cos(θ)** - Horizontal component
- **vy = v sin(θ)** - Vertical component
- **v = √(vx² + vy²)** - Magnitude from components
- **θ = tan⁻¹(vy/vx)** - Angle from components

## Learning Objectives

After using this MicroSim, students should be able to:

1. Break a vector into its x and y components
2. Apply trigonometric functions (sine, cosine) to find components
3. Reconstruct a vector from its components
4. Understand why vector decomposition is useful in physics
