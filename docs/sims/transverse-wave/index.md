## About This MicroSim

This interactive simulation demonstrates **transverse waves**, where particles oscillate perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. When you click "Send Pulse," a wave pulse travels from left to right across a line of connected particles. Each particle moves up and down (vertically) while the wave moves horizontally.

### Key Concepts Demonstrated

1. **Perpendicular Motion**: Particles move at right angles to the wave direction
2. **Wave Propagation**: Energy transfers from particle to particle without particles traveling with the wave
3. **Wave Properties**: Amplitude, wavelength, and wave speed can be adjusted independently

### Color Coding

- **Blue particles**: At rest or momentarily stationary
- **Green particles**: Moving upward
- **Pink particles**: Moving downward

### Controls

| Control | Range | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Amplitude | 5-50 pixels | Maximum displacement from equilibrium |
| Speed | 1-10 | Wave propagation speed (pixels per frame) |
| Wavelength | 50-200 pixels | Distance between wave crests |
| Send Pulse | Button | Launch a new wave pulse |
| Reset | Button | Return all particles to rest |
| Show particle paths | Checkbox | Display vertical path indicators |

## Learning Objectives

After using this simulation, students should be able to:

1. Describe how particles move in a transverse wave
2. Distinguish between the direction of particle motion and wave propagation
3. Explain the relationship between wavelength, amplitude, and wave speed
4. Predict how changing wave parameters affects the wave pattern

## Lesson Plan

### Introduction (5 minutes)
Ask students: "When you do 'the wave' at a sports stadium, do the people actually move around the stadium?" Use this to introduce the concept that waves transfer energy without transferring matter.

### Exploration (10 minutes)
1. Have students click "Send Pulse" and observe the motion
2. Ask: "Which way does the wave travel? Which way do the particles move?"
3. Enable "Show particle paths" to visualize the perpendicular motion

### Investigation (15 minutes)
Students explore how changing parameters affects the wave:
- What happens when you increase amplitude?
- What happens when you increase wavelength?
- What happens when you change speed?

### Discussion (10 minutes)
- Compare to real transverse waves: waves on strings, water surface waves, electromagnetic waves
- Contrast with longitudinal waves (see companion simulation)
