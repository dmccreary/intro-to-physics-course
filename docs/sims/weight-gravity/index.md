## About This MicroSim

This simulation demonstrates the critical difference between **mass** (constant everywhere) and **weight** (depends on local gravity). An astronaut with the same mass experiences different weights on Earth, Moon, Mars, and Jupiter.

## Key Concepts

- **Mass (m)**: Amount of matter - stays constant regardless of location
- **Weight (W)**: Gravitational force - calculated as W = mg
- **Gravitational acceleration (g)**: Varies by celestial body

| Body | g (m/s²) | 70 kg person weighs |
|------|----------|---------------------|
| Earth | 9.8 | 686 N |
| Moon | 1.6 | 112 N |
| Mars | 3.7 | 259 N |
| Jupiter | 24.8 | 1736 N |

## Learning Objectives

- Distinguish between mass and weight
- Apply W = mg to calculate weight on different planets
- Understand that weight is a force measured in Newtons
