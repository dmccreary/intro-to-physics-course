## About This Infographic

This interactive visualization connects rotational motion concepts to real-world applications across three domains:

1. **Engineering & Technology**: Flywheels, gyroscopes, centrifuges, wind turbines
2. **Sports & Recreation**: Figure skating, cycling, baseball, gymnastics
3. **Natural Phenomena**: Hurricanes, planetary formation, cat righting, Earth's rotation

## How to Use

Hover over any card to see detailed information about that application, including:
- The rotational physics concept involved
- Quantitative details and interesting facts
- How the principle is applied

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **Conservation of angular momentum**: Figure skating, hurricanes, planetary formation
- **Rotational kinetic energy**: Flywheels, energy storage
- **Gyroscopic stability**: Navigation systems, bicycle balance
- **Torque and rotational work**: Wind turbines, baseball pitching
- **Rotational inertia effects**: Gymnastics tumbling, cat righting

## Lesson Plan

### Discussion Activity

For each application, have students identify:
1. What is rotating?
2. What rotational concept explains the behavior?
3. How is this useful or significant?
