## About This Infographic

This interactive visualization compares energy efficiency across 16 common devices and processes. Efficiency measures what fraction of input energy becomes useful output energy.

## Key Equation

$$\text{Efficiency} = \frac{E_{output}}{E_{input}} \times 100\%$$

## Device Categories

- **Lighting**: LED, CFL, and incandescent bulbs
- **Engines**: Gasoline, diesel, and steam engines
- **Power Generation**: Coal, natural gas, solar, wind, and hydroelectric
- **Other**: Electric motors, muscles, bicycles, heaters, and heat pumps

## Interactive Features

- **Click any card** to expand and see detailed explanation
- **Filter buttons** to view specific categories
- **Summary stats** showing average, most efficient, and least efficient devices

## Special Cases

**Electric Heater (100%)**: When heat IS the desired output, all electrical energy becomes useful heat.

**Heat Pump (300%+)**: Not violating thermodynamics! Heat pumps MOVE heat rather than create it. The coefficient of performance (COP) measures heat moved per energy input, which can exceed 1.

## Learning Points

- Efficiency is always ≤100% for devices that convert energy (Second Law of Thermodynamics)
- Higher efficiency = less wasted energy = lower costs and environmental impact
- Even "inefficient" devices aren't destroying energy - they're converting it to unusable forms (usually heat)
