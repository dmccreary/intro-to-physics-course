## About This Infographic

This interactive visualization showcases the wide range of real-world applications for oscillation principles across six major fields. Click on any section to explore specific applications.

## Fields and Applications

### 💓 Medicine
- **Ultrasound imaging**: Uses MHz-range oscillations to create images
- **Heart monitoring**: Tracks periodic heartbeat oscillations
- **Ventilators**: Controlled pressure oscillations for breathing

### 🏗️ Architecture
- **Earthquake dampers**: Absorb seismic oscillations
- **Tuned mass dampers**: Counter building sway (Taipei 101: 300 tons!)
- **Bridge design**: Avoid resonance with wind/traffic

### 🎸 Music
- **String vibrations**: Fundamental and harmonic frequencies
- **Resonant bodies**: Amplify sound through resonance
- **Tuning forks**: Standard A4 = 440 Hz

### 🚗 Transportation
- **Shock absorbers**: Critically damped for comfort
- **Engine balancing**: Reduce destructive vibrations
- **Aircraft design**: Prevent wing flutter at high speeds

### 📡 Electronics
- **Crystal oscillators**: 32,768 Hz in every digital watch
- **Radio transmission**: Carrier wave oscillations
- **Signal filters**: Select frequencies using resonance

### 🏊 Sports
- **Diving boards**: Natural frequency ~2-4 Hz
- **Pole vault**: Energy storage in pole oscillation
- **Trampolines**: Periodic vertical oscillation
