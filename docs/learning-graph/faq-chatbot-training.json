Examples of vectors include displacement (50 m north), velocity (30 m/s eastward), force (100 N downward), and acceleration (9.8 m/s² toward Earth's center).

First Law (Inertia): An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with constant velocity unless acted upon by a net external force. Second Law: The net force on an object equals its mass times acceleration (F = ma), meaning heavier objects require more force to accelerate.

      "answer": "Work is the transfer of energy that occurs when a force acts on an object through a displacement in the direction of the force, measured in joules (J). Work equals force times displacement times the cosine of the angle between them: W = F·d·cos(θ). Only the component of force parallel to displacement does work. Lifting a 20-kg box 1.5 meters requires 294 joules of work against gravity. Importantly, if there's no displacement (pushing against a wall that doesn't move) or if force is perpendicular to motion (centripetal force in circular motion), zero work is done despite effort expended.",

      "answer": "Momentum is the product of an object's mass and velocity, representing its quantity of motion, measured in kg·m/s. A 2-kg ball moving at 5 m/s has momentum of 10 kg·m/s. Momentum is a vector quantity pointing in the direction of velocity. Heavy objects moving fast have large momentum and are difficult to stop. The Law of Conservation of Momentum states that in an isolated system (no external forces), total momentum remains constant. This explains why in collisions between billiard balls, the total momentum before impact equals the total momentum after.",

      "answer": "Precision refers to the reproducibility of measurements—how close repeated measurements are to each other—while accuracy refers to how close measurements are to the true or accepted value. You can have precise but inaccurate measurements (consistently measuring 9.2 m when the true value is 10.0 m) or accurate but imprecise measurements (measurements scatter around the true value: 9.8 m, 10.3 m, 9.9 m, 10.1 m). Ideal measurements are both precise (consistent) and accurate (correct). A poorly calibrated scale might give precise but inaccurate readings that cluster around the wrong value.",

      "answer": "Kinematic equations are four mathematical relationships connecting displacement, initial velocity, final velocity, acceleration, and time for uniformly accelerated motion (constant acceleration). The equations are: (1) v = v₀ + at, (2) x = x₀ + v₀t + ½at², (3) v² = v₀² + 2a(x - x₀), (4) x = x₀ + ½(v₀ + v)t. Use these equations only when acceleration is constant. They apply to free fall (constant a = g), projectile motion (constant vertical acceleration), and uniformly accelerated cars. They don't apply when acceleration changes, like a rocket with decreasing fuel mass or non-uniform circular motion.",

      "question": "What is centripetal force?",
      "answer": "Centripetal force is the net force directed toward the center of a circular path that causes an object to follow that curved trajectory rather than moving in a straight line. It's not a new type of force—it's the net result of real forces like tension, gravity, or friction acting toward the center. For circular motion at constant speed, centripetal force equals mv²/r, where m is mass, v is speed, and r is radius. When you swing a ball on a string, the string's tension provides centripetal force. For a car turning, friction between tires and road provides centripetal force.",

      "question": "Why do heavier and lighter objects fall at the same rate?",
      "answer": "This counterintuitive result follows from Newton's Second Law and the universal nature of gravitational acceleration. While heavier objects experience more gravitational force (F = mg), they also have more inertia (resistance to acceleration). The greater force and greater inertia exactly cancel: a = F/m = mg/m = g. All objects near Earth's surface accelerate downward at g = 9.8 m/s² regardless of mass. Air resistance obscures this in everyday experience—light objects like feathers have high surface area relative to weight, causing significant air drag. In vacuum (as demonstrated on the Moon), a feather and hammer fall together.",

Weight is the gravitational force acting on that mass (measured in newtons), calculated as W = mg where g is local gravitational acceleration. Your mass remains 70 kg whether on Earth, Moon, or in space. Your weight on Earth is 686 N (70 kg × 9.8 m/s²), on the Moon is 115 N (70 kg × 1.6 m/s²), and in deep space is nearly zero.

Vertical: uniformly accelerated motion with a = -g = -9.8 m/s², use kinematic equations with initial vertical velocity vᵧ₀ = v₀ sin(θ₀). Time is the linking variable connecting horizontal and vertical motions. Solve for time using one direction, then use that time in the other direction.

      "answer": "Both are fundamental conservation laws but apply in different contexts. Conservation of momentum requires no net external force and is a vector law (conserved in each direction independently). Conservation of energy (total energy including all forms) always holds, but conservation of mechanical energy requires no non-conservative forces. These laws are independent—they provide different constraints on physical systems. In elastic collisions, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved, giving you two equations to solve for two unknowns. In inelastic collisions, momentum is conserved but kinetic energy isn't, reflecting energy transformation to other forms.",

      "answer": "Dispersion—the separation of white light into its component colors—occurs because the refractive index of materials depends on wavelength. In glass, blue light (shorter wavelength) travels slower and refracts more than red light (longer wavelength). When white light enters a prism at an angle, different wavelengths refract by different amounts, separating spatially into a spectrum. The same phenomenon creates rainbows: water droplets act as prisms, dispersing sunlight. Dispersion limits optical system performance in telescopes and cameras, requiring special corrective lenses. It also enables spectroscopy—analyzing light composition by separating wavelengths.",
