## Areas for Enhancement

### Priority 1: Expand Concept Coverage (Moderate Priority)

**Current:** 47.5% concept coverage (95/200 concepts)
**Target:** 60%+ concept coverage
**Impact:** Would raise overall score from 88 to 92

**Recommendations:**
1. Add questions for 10-15 high-centrality uncovered concepts
2. Focus on Foundation concepts (graphical analysis, graphs)
3. Add technical questions for Oscillations and Optics (underrepresented taxonomies)
4. Consider adding 2-3 questions each for: Vector Components, Energy Diagrams, Power, Simple Machines, Wave Properties

**Estimated Questions Needed:** +20 questions
**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours

### Priority 2: Minor Bloom's Adjustments (Low Priority)

**Current:** 17.5% Remember (target 20%)
**Impact:** Minimal (already within acceptable range)

**Recommendations:**
1. Add 2-3 Remember-level questions for terminology
2. Focus on foundational terms from chapters 1-3
3. Consider definition-style questions for units, symbols, constants

**Estimated Questions Needed:** +2-3 questions
**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes

### Priority 3: Create Question (Optional)

**Current:** 3.75% Create (target 3%)
**Status:** Already meets target

**Optional Enhancement:**
Consider adding 1-2 Create-level questions like:
- "How would you design an experiment to measure [coefficient of friction/spring constant/etc.]?"
- "How could you combine [concepts] to build a [device/system]?"

These would support the course's emphasis on creative application and projects.
