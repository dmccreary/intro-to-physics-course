# High School Physics Course Description

Structured on the Revised Bloom's Taxonomy (2001)

## Course Overview

This year-long physics course develops students' scientific literacy through systematic progression from foundational knowledge to creative application. Students master physics concepts by sequentially building cognitive skills—from recalling fundamental principles to designing original experiments and novel solutions to real-world problems.  This is a hands-on course using equipment in our physics lab as well
as the use of extensive online interactive simulations (MicroSims) that keep students engaged.

## Why This Course

Picture this: you’re not just learning about the universe—you’re learning to speak its language. In this physics class, you’ll trade textbooks for trebuchets, memorization for machine-building, and passive note-taking for active world-bending. One day you’re calculating the perfect angle to sink a basketball shot; the next, you’re designing a Rube Goldberg machine that takes three minutes to flick a switch, then defending your design like a TED speaker. You’ll decode the physics behind your favorite video games, demolish movie scenes with real science, and turn lab day into a friendly competition to launch projectiles with laser precision. It’s a place where failure is just data, “Eureka!” moments happen weekly, and you’ll walk out seeing hidden mechanics in everything—from your phone’s touchscreen to the way light dances on water. Challenging? Absolutely. But between the collaborative chaos of creation, the thrill of cracking a problem that stumped you yesterday, and the sheer joy of making something move exactly as you predicted, you’ll realize the secret: physics isn’t just the foundation of engineering and technology—it’s one of the most genuinely fun rides high school has to offer.
