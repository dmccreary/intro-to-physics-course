# Physics History Graphic Novels

This section contains graphic novel stories about pivotal moments in the history of physics. Each story features approximately 12 illustrated panels that bring to life the discoveries, struggles, and triumphs of history's greatest physicists.

These stories are designed to:

- **Humanize physics** by showing the real people behind the equations
- **Inspire students** with tales of persistence, creativity, and breakthrough moments
- **Connect concepts** to their historical origins and practical applications
- **Highlight diversity** by including stories of women and underrepresented physicists
