    <summary>Narrative Prompt</summary>
Please generate a detailed narrative for a new graphic novel about Nikola Tesla
that is engaging and inspiring for teenagers. The target audience is high school
students studying introductory physics.

Tesla's story is one of vision against doubt, persistence against ridicule:
- Born in 1856 in the Serbian village of Smiljan (modern-day Croatia)
- Arrived in America in 1884 with four cents in his pocket and a letter of recommendation
- Worked briefly for Thomas Edison, who dismissed his AC ideas as dangerous fantasy
- Quit Edison's company after a broken promise of $50,000
- Found George Westinghouse, who believed in AC when no one else did
- Fought and won the "War of Currents" against Edison's DC power
- Lit the 1893 Chicago World's Fair with AC power—the most dramatic demonstration in history
- Built the first AC hydroelectric power plant at Niagara Falls
- Invented the AC motor, polyphase electrical systems, the Tesla coil, radio fundamentals
- Envisioned wireless power, smartphones, and the internet decades before they existed
- Died poor and alone in a New York hotel room, his genius finally recognized too late

The story should emphasize that being right isn't enough—you must persist when everyone
says you're wrong. Tesla was mocked, cheated, and dismissed by the establishment, but
he never stopped believing in his vision. He saw the future more clearly than anyone,
and he fought to make it real.

### Prologue – The Boy Who Saw Lightning

In 1856, during a violent lightning storm, a baby was born in a small village in the Austrian Empire. The midwife declared it a bad omen: "This child will be a child of darkness."

His mother replied: "No. He will be a child of light."

His name was **Nikola Tesla**. And he would grow up to literally light the world.

From childhood, he saw things others couldn't—complete inventions appearing in his mind, fully formed and functioning. He could visualize machines so precisely that he could test them mentally before ever building them. Doctors called it a disorder. Tesla called it a gift.

This is the story of how a penniless immigrant with impossible dreams defeated the most powerful inventor in America—and gave humanity the electric age.

Please generate a new 16:9 w:h ratio illustration.
A colorful, bright illustration of a room of mid-19th century Eastern European village showing Tesla's dramatic birth in Smiljan in 1856. The scene is a bedroom in a small stone house with a large window. Outside, through the window, we see a violent thunderstorm—lightning fills the sky, illuminating the village. In the bedroom a baby has just been born and is being
held by his mother. The midwife looks out the window, frightened at the storm, but the mother gazes at her newborn with fierce love. Outside, lightning strikes repeatedly, as if announcing something momentous. The scene should blend the humble village setting with supernatural electrical drama. Young Nikola seems to glow faintly even as an infant, connected somehow to the storm outside.
</details>

## Chapter 1 – A Mind Like No Other

Young Nikola was different. He experienced intense visions—flashes of light, complete machines appearing in his mind, ideas so vivid they seemed more real than reality. Doctors worried. His parents prayed.

But Tesla learned to harness these visions. He could imagine a machine, examine it from every angle in his mind, run it mentally, find the flaws, and fix them—all without drawing a single line on paper.

"My method is different," he later wrote. "I do not rush into actual work. When I have an idea, I start at once building it up in my imagination."

At 17, he nearly died from cholera. His father, who wanted him to become a priest, promised that if Nikola survived, he could study engineering instead.

Tesla survived. And his destiny began.

The scene shows teenage Tesla in his room, but his imagination is visible: ghostly, translucent blueprints of machines float around him—motors, generators, devices that don't exist yet. His eyes are closed in concentration as a fully-formed electric motor rotates in the air before him, glowing with inner light. Books on electricity and engineering are scattered around. Through the window, the real world is mundane, but inside Tesla's mind, the future is already being built. Other students outside look normal; Tesla is clearly extraordinary.
</details>

## Chapter 2 – The Vision in the Park

In 1882, while walking through a Budapest park at sunset, Tesla had the breakthrough that would change history.

He had been wrestling with a problem: how to create an electric motor that didn't need brushes—the sparking, wearing parts that made existing motors unreliable. The solution had eluded him for years.

Then, while reciting poetry to a friend, it struck him like lightning. He saw it complete: a rotating magnetic field, created by alternating currents out of phase with each other. The field itself would spin, dragging the motor with it. No brushes. No sparks. Perfect rotation.

He grabbed a stick and drew the design in the dirt. **The AC induction motor was born**—in a park, at sunset, from pure imagination.

Above Tesla's head, visible only to him (and us), the complete AC induction motor appears as a glowing, rotating diagram—magnetic field lines spinning, rotor following. Below, Tesla is frantically drawing in the dirt with a stick. The sunset paints everything in dramatic oranges and purples. The scene captures the exact moment when the future of electrical power was conceived.
</details>

## Chapter 3 – Four Cents and a Dream

In 1884, Tesla arrived in New York City. He had four cents in his pocket, the clothes on his back, and a letter of introduction to the most famous inventor in America: **Thomas Edison**.

Edison was the king of electricity. His direct current (DC) power stations were lighting Manhattan. His name meant "genius" to millions. Getting Edison's approval would mean everything.

Tesla walked into Edison's office and presented his ideas for alternating current. Motors without brushes. Power transmitted over hundreds of miles. A complete system that could electrify the world.

Edison listened. Then dismissed it all.

"Forget your fancy AC," Edison said. "It's dangerous. Impractical. Stick with DC."

But he offered Tesla a job anyway—fixing the problems with Edison's own DC generators.

Tesla, tall and immaculately dressed despite his poverty, stands before him with passionate intensity, gesturing as he explains AC power. Edison's assistants smirk in the background. On Tesla's side of the room, faint ghostly images of his AC vision appear—motors, generators, transmission lines. Edison's side is dark, smoky, chaotic with DC equipment. The tension between the two visions of the future is palpable.
</details>

## Chapter 4 – The Broken Promise

Tesla worked obsessively for Edison, often 18 hours a day. He solved problems that had stumped Edison's best engineers. He redesigned Edison's DC generators, making them far more efficient.

According to Tesla, Edison made him a promise: improve the generators, and there would be a $50,000 bonus—a fortune in 1884.

Tesla delivered. The generators were transformed.

Edison laughed. "Tesla, you don't understand our American humor."

There would be no bonus. Not even a raise.

Tesla quit on the spot. He walked out of Edison's company with nothing—no job, no money, and an enemy in the most powerful inventor in the country.

But he still had his ideas. And now he was free to pursue them.

The lighting emphasizes the contrast: Edison in comfortable warm light, Tesla in harsh shadows as he's being cast out. Through the window, the electric lights of Edison's New York glow—the empire Tesla helped build but will never share in. The scene captures betrayal and the birth of a rivalry.
</details>

## Chapter 5 – The Darkest Year

1886 was Tesla's lowest point. Without Edison's backing, no one would fund his AC ideas. He was reduced to digging ditches for $2 a day—the same hands that had conceived the AC motor now blistered from manual labor.

The foreman of the work crew once asked what Tesla did before.

"I'm an electrical engineer," Tesla said.

The foreman laughed. "Sure you are. Keep digging."

But even in the ditches, Tesla never stopped thinking. He calculated. He designed. He refined his AC system in his mind, making it better, more practical, more complete.

He knew he was right. He just needed one person to believe him.

A colorful, bright wide-landscape illustration in a Gilded Age American social realism style showing Tesla's year of hardship in 1886. Tesla, his fine clothes now worn and dirty, digs a ditch alongside other laborers in a New York street. His face shows exhaustion but also distant concentration—even now, he's thinking. Above his head, faint and ghostly, his AC motor designs still spin—his mind never stops working. Other workers rest on their shovels, but Tesla works methodically. In the background, Edison's electric lights illuminate fancy buildings—a cruel irony. One small detail: Tesla's eyes still burn with intensity despite everything. The scene shows genius humbled but not defeated.
</details>

## Chapter 6 – The Believer

In 1887, Tesla finally found his champion: **George Westinghouse**, a brilliant industrialist who had already made millions from railroad air brakes.

Westinghouse was Edison's business rival—and he understood immediately what Tesla had created. AC could do what DC never could: transmit power over long distances without massive losses. It could electrify not just cities, but entire nations.

Westinghouse bought Tesla's AC patents for $60,000 plus royalties—finally giving Tesla the resources to build his dreams.

"The future of electricity," Westinghouse declared, "is alternating current."

Edison was furious. The **War of Currents** had begun.

Both men look determined, like generals planning a campaign. On the wall, diagrams of Tesla's AC system are prominently displayed. Through the window, the Westinghouse Electric factory is visible. The lighting is bright and optimistic—finally, someone believes. In contrast to the Edison confrontation, this scene shows mutual respect and shared vision.
</details>

## Chapter 7 – The War of Currents

Edison fought dirty. He couldn't beat AC on technical merits, so he attacked it as deadly.

Edison's team publicly electrocuted animals—dogs, horses, even an elephant—using alternating current, calling it proof that AC was a killer. They invented the electric chair using AC, specifically to associate Tesla's system with death.

Edison coined a term for electrocution: to be "Westinghoused."

Newspapers ran terrifying stories. Politicians called for AC to be banned. Edison testified that AC was too dangerous to ever use in homes.

Tesla and Westinghouse fought back with facts: DC was equally dangerous, and AC was far more practical. But facts don't always win against fear.

They needed a dramatic demonstration.

## Chapter 8 – The White City

The 1893 Chicago World's Fair—the Columbian Exposition—would showcase the wonders of the modern age to 27 million visitors. The fair's organizers wanted it lit by electricity, and they wanted it spectacular.

Edison bid for the contract at $554,000. Westinghouse, using Tesla's AC system, bid $399,000.

Westinghouse won.

Tesla and his team worked frantically to build the system. On May 1, 1893, President Grover Cleveland pressed a button, and 100,000 incandescent bulbs blazed to life.

The "White City" stunned the world. Visitors who had never seen electric light gasped at the brilliance. The message was undeniable: **AC worked. AC was safe. AC was the future.**

Edison's fear campaign collapsed in a blaze of light.

American flags wave. Fountains sparkle. The night sky above is dark, making the electric brilliance even more stunning. This is the moment AC won the War of Currents—not through argument, but through undeniable demonstration of beauty and power.
</details>

## Chapter 9 – Harnessing Niagara

Even before the World's Fair, planners had been debating how to harness Niagara Falls—one of the greatest sources of power on Earth. Edison insisted only DC could work. Tesla knew AC was the only practical choice.

In 1893, the Niagara Falls Power Company chose Westinghouse and Tesla's AC system.

By 1896, the first AC hydroelectric power plant was complete. Electricity generated at Niagara traveled 26 miles to Buffalo, New York—a distance impossible for DC.

Tesla returned to Niagara Falls and stood before the thundering water. Fourteen years earlier, as a student, he had told his professor he would one day harness these falls with alternating current.

His professor had called him a dreamer.

Now the dream was real.

The scene should convey the scale of the achievement: humanity harnessing one of nature's greatest forces. A plaque reads: "Alternating Current—Tesla System."
</details>

## Chapter 10 – The Wizard's Laboratory

With his royalties and fame, Tesla built a legendary laboratory in New York City. Here he conducted experiments that seemed like magic.

He created the **Tesla coil**—capable of producing millions of volts, shooting lightning bolts across the room. He lit fluorescent tubes wirelessly, years before such lights were invented. He transmitted electrical energy through the air without wires.

Visitors watched in amazement as Tesla stood unharmed amid artificial lightning, electricity coursing around his body. Mark Twain became a regular visitor and friend.

Tesla was no longer the penniless ditch digger. He was the most famous inventor in the world—"The Wizard of Electricity."

</details>

## Chapter 11 – Dreams Too Big

Tesla's visions grew ever more ambitious. At Colorado Springs in 1899, he built a massive magnifying transmitter and created artificial lightning bolts 130 feet long—the largest man-made electrical discharges in history.

He became convinced he could transmit power wirelessly around the entire planet. He began building Wardenclyffe Tower on Long Island—a 187-foot tower that would broadcast free electricity to the world.

But his investor, J.P. Morgan, had funded the project expecting a wireless communication system, not free power. When Morgan realized Tesla wanted to give electricity away for free, he withdrew his support.

"Where do I put the meter?" Morgan allegedly asked.

Without funding, Wardenclyffe was never completed. Tesla's greatest dream died unfinished.

The sky is divided—half showing the brilliant future Tesla imagined, half showing the gray reality of abandoned ambition. Triumph and tragedy in one image.
</details>

## Chapter 12 – The Forgotten Genius

Tesla's final decades were difficult. He gave up his Westinghouse royalties to save the company during a financial crisis—sacrificing millions. He moved from hotel to hotel, increasingly eccentric, feeding pigeons in the park, claiming to receive messages from other planets.

The scientific establishment that once celebrated him now ignored him. Edison had died a hero; Tesla lived as a curiosity.

But Tesla never stopped thinking, never stopped inventing. In his papers, discovered after his death, were designs for vertical takeoff aircraft, particle beam weapons, wireless smartphones, and concepts that wouldn't be understood for decades.

On January 7, 1943, Nikola Tesla died alone in Room 3327 of the New Yorker Hotel. He was 86 years old.

Through the window, the New York skyline blazes with electric light—all powered by his inventions, but bearing Edison's name in the history books. The scene is bittersweet: poverty surrounded by the fruits of his genius. A forgotten prophet in the world he created.
</details>

## Chapter 13 – Lightning Returns

Today, Nikola Tesla is finally recognized as one of the greatest inventors in history. His name adorns the unit of magnetic flux density. The most innovative electric car company in the world bears his name.

His contributions power our civilization:

- **Alternating current** lights our homes and runs our industries
- **The AC induction motor** powers everything from elevators to electric vehicles
- **Polyphase electrical systems** form the backbone of power grids worldwide
- **Radio** (his patents, though long disputed) enabled wireless communication
- **Fluorescent lighting** came from his experiments with vacuum tubes
- **Remote control** was first demonstrated by Tesla in 1898

Every time you flip a light switch, you're using Tesla's gift to humanity.

### Call to Action

Nikola Tesla arrived in America with four cents. The most famous inventor in the country called him a fool. He dug ditches to survive. He died alone in a hotel room.

But he never stopped believing in his vision of the future.

He invented:
- The electrical system that powers the modern world
- The motor technology in electric vehicles
- The principles behind wireless communication
- Ideas about smartphones and the internet—in 1900

How?

- He **saw what others couldn't**—and trusted his vision over their doubt
- He **refused to give up** when everyone said he was wrong
- He **found believers** when the establishment rejected him
- He **let his work speak** instead of arguing with critics
- He **thought in decades** while others thought in days

The experts laughed at Tesla. Edison called him impractical. Financiers called him crazy. The newspapers called AC a death current.

They were all wrong. He was right.

What vision do you have that others doubt? What idea are you holding back because someone might laugh?

Tesla's lesson is simple: **Being ahead of your time isn't a flaw. It's a superpower.**
