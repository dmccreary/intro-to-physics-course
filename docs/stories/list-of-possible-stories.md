 Here are 10 compelling stories that would work well as 12-panel graphic novels, balancing scientific significance, visual drama, and diversity:

  Stories Featuring Women Physicists

  1. Marie Curie: Glowing in the Dark (Radioactivity)

  The grueling work in a leaky shed, discovering polonium and radium, the dramatic glow of radioactive samples, and becoming the first person to win two Nobel Prizes. Visual highlight: the eerie blue glow of radium in the dark laboratory.

  2. Lise Meitner: The Fission Escape (Nuclear Physics)

  Fleeing Nazi Germany with a diamond ring sewn into her coat, then discovering nuclear fission while in exile—only to be snubbed for the Nobel Prize. Visual highlight: the "aha moment" on a snowy Christmas walk in Sweden.

  3. Chien-Shiung Wu: Breaking Parity (Conservation Laws)

  The "First Lady of Physics" designs the brilliant experiment proving parity violation—while the two men who proposed the theory win the Nobel without her. Visual highlight: the intricate cobalt-60 experiment at cryogenic temperatures.

  4. Vera Rubin: The Missing Universe (Gravity/Motion)

  Facing sexism at every turn (denied access to Palomar Observatory because there was no women's restroom), she discovers that galaxies rotate "wrong"—revealing dark matter. Visual highlight: galaxy rotation curves that don't match predictions.

  Classic Physics Stories

  5. Galileo: The Trial of Truth (Kinematics/Astronomy)

  Dropping balls from the Leaning Tower, building telescopes, discovering Jupiter's moons, and facing the Inquisition. Visual highlight: Galileo peering through his telescope at the phases of Venus.

  6. Newton: The Plague Year (Mechanics/Optics/Gravity)

  Sent home from Cambridge during the plague, a 23-year-old Newton invents calculus, discovers the spectrum of light, and contemplates gravity watching an apple fall. Visual highlight: the prism splitting white light into a rainbow.

  7. Archimedes: Eureka! (Density/Buoyancy)

  The king suspects his crown is fake gold. Archimedes, stepping into his bath, realizes how to solve it—and runs naked through Syracuse shouting "Eureka!" Visual highlight: the crown submerged in water, revealing the fraud.

  8. Faraday: The Bookbinder's Apprentice (Electromagnetism)

  A self-educated bookbinder attends Humphry Davy's lectures, becomes his assistant, and eventually surpasses his mentor by discovering electromagnetic induction. Visual highlight: the first electric motor spinning.

  9. Rutherford: The Gold Foil Surprise (Atomic Structure)

  Alpha particles shot at gold foil—most pass through, but some bounce straight back. "As if you fired a cannon at tissue paper and it came back and hit you." Visual highlight: the dramatic backscatter revealing the atomic nucleus.

  10. Einstein: The Patent Clerk's Daydream (Relativity)

  A 26-year-old patent clerk imagines riding a beam of light, revolutionizing physics in his "miracle year" of 1905 with four groundbreaking papers. Visual highlight: the famous thought experiment of chasing a light beam.
